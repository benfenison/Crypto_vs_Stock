### Key Points

* Breadth analysis can help us determine the strength of an index trend.
* There are a few ways to analyze breadth. We examine ADP and the percent of stocks above their 50-day moving average.
* We analyze the breadth of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq-100, and S&amp;P 500.

## The S&amp;P 500 Makes New All-Time Highs

The S&amp;P 500 has made new all-time highs this past week, passing the previous high in January. The index has climbed nearly 15% since hitting its 200-day moving average in early February. 

Now is a perfect time to perform a breadth check to see how this current uptrend is performing, and see what information we can extract from a breadth analysis. 

## What is Breadth?

Indices like the S&amp;P 500 are generally measured as a standalone unit. Many investors use this as a proxy for the overall stock market. If the S&amp;P 500 moved up, then the market as a whole did well. 

The S&amp;P 500, and indices in general, are made up of individual sectors and stocks. One way to gauge the health of an index is to look at the individual sectors/holdings that make it up. This is breadth analysis. Breadth analysis gives us the ability to determine how many stocks are moving with the index, and how many are diverging from it.

This analysis gives us an idea of how strong the current index trend is. If 60-75% of the stocks are moving with the index, we can say the current trend is healthy. However, if we start to see individual components of the index start to diverge, then the trend is weakening.  

## How Do We Measure Breadth?

We can analyze breadth in several ways. For an index like the Dow Jones Industrial Average, we could analyze each individual stock and determine how many stocks we expect to move with the current trend, and how many are moving against it. 

However, this is only possible because the index is made up of 30 stocks. For an index like the S&amp;P 500, which is made up of 505 stocks, we can use indicators that group all of the them together into one data point.

### The Advance Decline Percentage Indicator (ADP)

The Advance decline Percent line measures the percentage of stocks that moved with the index versus the ones that moved against it. This data can be shown as an individual bar chart, or cumulative to create a line graph. 

This line should look similar to the index. A signal comes if the cumulative ADP line starts to diverge from the index.

### Stocks Above Their Moving Average

This indicator determines the percentage of stocks in the index that have a greater price than a specified moving average. In an uptrend, a healthy index will have 60-75% stocks greater than there 50 day moving average. 

This oscillator looks more like a traditional technical indicator, as it is limited to 0-100%. Since this indicator uses moving averages, momentum is a factor. This indicator tells us when momentum is weakening in the index trend. 

As stated before, a healthy uptrend will have 60-75% of their stocks above their 50-day moving average. If the indicator falls between 50-60%, then it could be a sign of a weakening trend, and anything below 50 would point towards a down trend. 

If the indicator goes above 80%, it could be a sign of over exuberance and the index could correct, as we saw in January.  

## Breadth Analysis

### Dow Jones Industrial Average 

The index has strong breadth, and it could be a sign of a continued uptrend. Between January and July, the index was rather volatile. This can also be seen in the cumulative ADP line, as it bounced between a range during the same time period. It has since broken out with the index, confirming a bullish move. 

The stocks above the 50-day moving average indicator is currently at 83%, which is okay for the index. Earlier in the blog I said that it could be a negative sign if the indicator was above 80%. It is different with this index though. With only 30 holdings, each component is worth 3.33%, so the indicator is much more volatile.  

### Nasdaq-100 Breadth 

“The Nasdaq-100 Index includes 100 of the largest domestic and international non-financial companies listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market based on market capitalization” ([Source](https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/indices/nasdaq-100.aspx)). 

The breadth of this index is great. The cumulative ADP line shows that the index never really had any problems. The line was more volatile from January to July, but it never broke the uptrend.

However, the stocks above the 50-day moving average is weakening. The index still has 65% of the stocks above their moving average, so it is still considered healthy. For now, we will want to watch the indicator and make sure it doesn’t continue to weaken. 

### S&amp;P 500 Breadth 

The S&amp;P 500 has strong breadth as well. Both indicators are still pointing to a strong uptrend. 

The buy signal came when the cumulative ADP moved past 4500, and the index broke out of the pennant/flag formation. Breadth analysis provided a confirmation of the breakout, which is another way investors can use breadth in their trading.  

## Conclusion

It is important to understand that breadth is only part of a complete analysis, but the high breadth is a good sign for the future of the stock market. We will need to monitor the Nasdaq-100 stocks above their 50-day moving average, but that is the only problem we see. 

Since the Nasdaq-100 is mostly made up of technology stocks, it could be a sign that investors are being more selective with their technology companies. 

The technology sector has been leading the market higher for the last few years, but now that we are drawing closer to the end of the economic cycle, it may be time for another sector to take over, such as consumer discretionary stocks. 

Still, it is not a sign of any impending danger. For now, it is just something to watch.

"These are the latest Schedule 13D forms filed by activist investors in the last 7 days. Activist
investors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.
There is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.
Schedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management
(such as Index funds).

There is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize
is that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.
The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.
In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

"This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,

"*DISCLAIMER* This isn’t a pro Trump post, I’m just stating a pattern I’m seeing.

Ever since the president started the tariffs 6 months ago everyone has been pretty chicken little about it. Sure it could cause a downturn but the full effects are yet to happen so that remains unknown. But every time a news story about this drops the comments are always about how we’re going to repeat 2008 or how the next one will be a depression and people believe it. What kind of crystal balls do they have? It is impossible to know the severity of a recession before it even happens but these guys don’t want to hear it, because everyone who brings that point up gets downvoted to oblivion. It’s almost like their hatred for the president is doing the thinking for them, kind of like how people who hated Obama to this degree were certain of hyperinflation and economic collapse earlier in the decade.

"Pacton Gold (TSX.V: PAC.V) (OTC: PACXF) so far has had a good week, thanks to the continuous flow of announcements from the company. Along with these positive announcements, the marginal recovery in the gold price has also likely encouraged the investors to show their love for Pacton.   


Announcements from Pacton Gold   
On Monday, Pacton Gold announced another acquisition to further grow its portfolio in the Western Australia Pilbara region. The company announced that it entered into a binding letter of intent to buy conglomerate gold rights from Calidus Resources Limited. It is another significant acquisition for Pacton as Calidus previously has recovered nuggets near to the mapped conglomerate.   


“Securing the conglomerate gold rights over this significant portfolio of tenements from Calidus further consolidates Pacton’s position in the Pilbara region of Western Australia,” said Pacton’s Interim President and CEO – Alec Pismiris.   


On Tuesday, Pacton Gold came up another announcement of appointing Allan J. Folk and Alec Pismiris as directors. “They both have extensive experience in the mining sector and capital markets and are ideal candidates for moving Pacton forward,” said Dominic Verdejo, Chairman of the Board.   


Folk has more than 35 years of experience in the Canadian mining finance space. He has worked at senior positions for both junior and advanced Canadian companies. Folk, who is currently the Vice President of Brant Securities, is also a director of Bonterra Resources and Monarca Minerals, and the Chairman of Atlanta Gold.   


Similarly, Pismiris have over 30 years of experience in the securities, finance and mining industries. Currently, he is the director of many ASX listed companies. He is the founding shareholder and director of Cardinal Resources Limited, which found the Ghana’s Namdini Gold Project.   


Expect positive movement in gold prices   
In addition to these announcements, a marginal recovery in the gold prices has also helped in pushing the stock up this week. However, it remains to be seen if the yellow metal is able to retain this movement and continue the move up. At the time of this writing, things were not looking well for the gold as it was dropping again following an uptick in the dollar.   


Going ahead, however, there are good chances that we may see the gold prices to rally. Several emerging countries and governments, which are at some level of war against the US, are stocking gold to lower their dependence on the dollar. Several countries are selling dollars fearing unpredictable diplomatic actions from Trump administration.   


At the end of June, Philippines, for instance, had 196.4 tons of gold, an increase of 20% from 2010. Similarly, Indonesia has raised its gold holdings by 10% during the same period. Russia, which is facing U.S. economic sanctions, is consistently boosting its gold holdings, which is now the fifth biggest among the world’s central banks. At the end of June, Russian central bank had 1,944 tons of gold, up 6% since the end of 2017.   


Iran too is witnessing a rise in gold purchases. During the first half of the year, sales of bullion and coins in the country have almost tripled from the same period last year, according to the data from the World Gold Council. Moreover, analysts expect these countries to continue with their gold buying.   


Even the US dollar is expected to lose its strength going ahead. “Currently, the U.S. economy is in very good shape because of the positive effects of the tax cuts, but the time will come when the U.S. will face negative consequences of the measure,” Itsuo Toshima, a market analyst, told Nikkie Asian Review.   


Conclusion   
Demand for gold from these countries, and the expected uncertainty in the US economy will be good for gold prices and gold stocks. And, Pacton Gold with its impressive portfolio and robust management team is poised well to benefit from this.

# Who is Winning in Retail?

### Key Points

* Retail is far from dead.
* This earnings season has highlighted the strength of the retail industry.
* Specialty niche retailers have struggled.
* Large retailers with diverse products tend to perform better.

## The Death of Retail?

The death of retail has been a common belief among a lot of investors. Amazon and the internet had taken the retail world by storm, causing brick and mortar stores to shut down, and business to dwindle. The retail apocalypse was upon us, and it seemed like there was nothing big retailers could do to stop it.

I previously wrote about retail, more specifically, the fact that the XRT retail ETF had made new highs earlier this year. At the time, there was doubt the highs would last. Not because retail is doomed, but because trade disputes promised to raise the price of goods retailers sell. 

However, the trade rhetoric has largely gone unnoticed in the U.S. economy, and retail earnings are showing signs of a strong consumer.

News outlets, like Bloomberg, seem to consistently show one retailer doing very well and one doing poorly. This has led me to believe there is a divide in the retail industry, and it could possibly be exploited, if I can determine what is causing the divide. So that is the goal of this post.

## Industry Losers

The first step was to select the stocks. Large retail companies were chosen, such as Best Buy, Lululemon, Ross, and Nordstrom’s. These are national companies, and cater to a lot of the economy. 

The list of companies varies from discount stores to electronics to high-end retail. Overall, I looked at 20 stocks to try and determine which retailers were dying, and which ones were thriving.

Of the 20 stocks analyzed, only four were given a sell rating: JC Penny, Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond, Gap, and GameStop. At this point, all investors know JC penny is failing. They have not been able to innovate their stores to attract a solid customer base. 

## GameStop 

Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond and GameStop are specialty niche stores, and that may be their problem. GameStop sells video games, but now competes with several different Netflix-like options. 

Xbox Game Pass, EA Access, and Game Fly are all options for consumers to play video games, without actually committing to owning the game. Instead, consumers pay a monthly fee to play an assortment of games as they please. 

## Bed Bath &amp; Beyond 

Bed, Bath and Beyond’s niche is in home goods. The problem is that this is all they sell. Consumers only go to the store for one-off home items, and not much else. People don’t need to go to a department store for their home every week. 

When they do want to, Amazon, Wayfair, and other internet based companies can provide consumers with their needs. Internet users can also use reviews to determine a good product. Retailers cannot provide this type of insight in store. 

## Gap Inc. 

Gap’s problems are not so easily identifiable. The company owns Gap, Old Navy, and Banana Republic. While Old Navy continues to grow, these stores are simply performing weaker than analysts expect. The sell rating is based on the reaction post earnings report.

## What Makes a Good Retailer?

### Discounts/Value

Retailers like Target or Kohl’s focus on saving money. Shoppers feel like they are getting a good value, and that may allow them to buy more than they otherwise would. Plus they have a large assortment of products in their stores. 

### Variety 

A consumer can go in looking for a shirt, but as they walk through the store they are surrounded by many other items. This can potentially influence more sales as the customer sees other products. 

In addition, the wide range of products is also convenient for customers. At Target, customers can buy milk and a t-shirt in one trip to the same store.

### Diversified Selection 

A variety of products is a characteristic of a good retailer, but so is a diverse selection of one type of product , such as clothes. Nordstrom’s is doing well, but they really only sell apparel. However, they carry a vast amount of brands and types of clothing, similar to Ross and TJ Max, but with a focus on high end fashion. 

When a customer visits their stores, whether it is the regular store or Nordstrom’s Rack, they are able to look through their vast selection and compare brands and prices. It provides an easier experience. This is also how Best Buy operates, but with electronics.

## Conclusion

Retail is far from dead. Large retailers, and consumer discretionary stocks in general, are pulling the stock market up. While it can be argued that Amazon has changed the way people shop, it could also be argued that consumers felt a lot weaker prior to the election of Trump. His election has been credited with the revival of “animal spirits” in the economy. 

Strong consumer confidence has brought people out to the stores to go shopping in person. More people are willing to spend their money, and retailers are reaping the benefits. 

Retailers that can provide a good value and convenience, are seeing better earnings and stronger stock prices. As long as consumers keep their confidence in the economy, these stores should continue to do well.

"This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

"These are the latest Schedule 13D forms filed by activist investors in the last 7 days. Activist
investors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.
There is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.
Schedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management
(such as Index funds).

There is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize
is that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.
The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.
In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

## New Filings
This table lists new 13D filings in the last week. A new filing does not necessarily indicate a new position,
as investors frequently accumulate in advance before reaching the filing threshold.

"For those that follow me regularly, you will know that I have been tracking a set-up for the SPDR Gold Trust ETF (GLD), which I analyze as a proxy for the gold market. I also believe that gold can outperform the general equity market once we confirm a long-term break out has begun.

While I have gone on record as to why I do not think the GLD ETF is a wise long-term investment hold, I still use it to track the market movements. For those that have not seen my webinar about why I don’t think the GLD is a wise long-term investment, feel free to [review my webinar](https://www.elliottwavetrader.net/videos/Risks-of-Trading-SPDR-Gold-Shares-GLD-201411131445.html) on the matter.

Since it seems that some of you have been confused by what my perspective for 2018 has been when it comes to GLD, I would like to take a moment to outline it again so we can all be clear:

&gt;*As far as my expectation for the metals, when we came into 2018, I was quite bullish the metals as they had a strong 1-2, i-ii set up to the upside. I have noted many times that if a chart that presents a long-term bullish perspective, such as metals, provides a shorter-term bullish potential set up, I will always defer to that set up as my primary expectation. That is what I did with the metals coming into 2018. But, I provided a clear guide that this will remain a strong perspective only if GLD remains over 119. I noted quite clearly that if GLD were to drop below 119, it would make me question that immediate perspective.*   
*Moreover, when GLD then broke below 117.40, I said many times that this immediate bullish set up will now take months to resurrect. I also noted that I thought the 113 region would likely be tested, and if broken, would suggest that GLD would not bottom until we reached the 105-109 region. Thus far, this seems to be what is playing out.* 

And, as I said last weekend:

&gt;*As the market has certainly followed through to the downside as outlined above, the potential for seeing that 105 region has increased. But, first, I want to see the market bounce back up towards the 115-116 region. While I am also tracking the potential that we struck a bottom to gold this past week in the overnight market, I don’t see that as the higher probability at this time. Rather, the market will have to prove that to me with an impulsive structure through the 116.50 region. So, I will be watching the next rally quite closely for the structure it develops up to the 115-116 region resistance. Should it be clearly corrective, then I will be looking down for a fifth wave drop to the 109 region, with the potential for an overly emotional reaction as deep as the 105 region.*

In the seven years since I have been writing publicly, anyone who has closely followed me knows that I am neither bull nor bear. Rather, I simply follow what the market is telling me. So, when I turned bearish on metals in late 2011, many thought me to be wrong, or simply crazy. And, when I turned strongly bullish again at the end of 2015, many thought me to be wrong, with fewer people thinking I was crazy.

Now, when I was very bullish coming into 2018, many seemed to be quite happy about that. But, they seemed to have retained that view of me all the way down, rather than listening to the me or the market. You see, once the market breaks a support, one has to recognize that something has changed, and you must change your perspective along with it. And, when the market broke 117.40, I changed my perspective, wherein I looked for a drop down to the 113 region, and potentially even as deep as the 105-109 region. Yet, many viewed me still as being bullish in the smaller time frame all the way down.

This brings me to yet another point about market analysis and trading/investing. You must know and understand the time frames with which you are dealing. For example, while I was still “bullish” based upon the much larger degree perspectives, my shorter to intermediate term perspectives certainly changed when we broke 117.40. And, the closer we get to our lower targets, the more you will see me turn towards the bullish side of the market again, just as I did towards the end of 2015.

Remember, markets are non-linear environments, and one has to align their thinking with such an environment. So, I sincerely hope this assists those who read my analysis in understanding how to view the perspectives I present in my write ups.

This past week, one of my members noted a comment made by a well followed market pundit. The comment reiterated a sentiment that seems to be making the rounds regarding gold. It seems that the reason that gold has been dropping precipitously is because millennials don’t care about gold. Rather, according the common theme today, the millennials are more interested in novel investments like cryptocurrencies, which is what has been driving demand away from precious metals.

I have one question for all of those who believe in this ridiculous perspective: Have you looked at the two charts lately?

Gold has been dropping since April and the crypto-currencies have been dropping since January. This is one of those occasions where my third-grade teacher’s wisdom rings true once again: put brain in gear before engaging mouth. This is one of the problems I have with this type of analysis. People say things that may sound good to the masses, but that simply does not make it true.

So, allow me to present an alternative perspective which actually aligns itself with price trends. If the assumption is that the millennials are willing to pay more for something that is rising, which has taken money away from gold which has been declining, then it is quite obvious what that something is: alcohol. After reading [this article](http://fortune.com/2018/04/22/cocktail-price-rising/) in Fortune, it became abundantly clear that it was not the buying of crypto-currencies that has caused gold to drop, but the fact that millennials are paying more to get their buzz. This reason at least aligns well with the two price trends and certainly makes a lot more sense than the reasons espoused by the pundits above.

As far as the GLD is concerned, as long as we remain below the 115/116 region and do not see an impulsive structure breaking out through that resistance, I am looking for a lower low before a long term bottom is struck. Moreover, that low can even be as deep as the 105 region, wherein we have an a=c target for this larger degree 2nd wave we have been mired within for the last 2 years. And, should we be able to see a strong break out in the coming two weeks through the 116.50 level, then it opens the door to gold having bottomed. But, unfortunately, there are still a number of miners that will likely take a bit longer until they complete their pullback.

The fact that the market has dropped as deeply as it has can either be a point of frustration for you, or a huge opportunity. Much depends on how you control your emotions and view the market. But, I would strongly suggest you view this larger degree pullback as an opportunity to own assets in this complex at prices you may not again see in your lifetime.

"Bought NNLX years ago, more years than I would like to admit. They (Nanologix) invented and patented some rapid detection petri dish products that can detect many different types of bacteria or virus's in super fast time. Some of the bacteria this product was tested with are:
Ecoli
Salmonella
Gonorrhea
Listeria
Strep
And 100 more (see test result page on nanologix.com)

Not knowing anything about bio-med myself I just read what they had on their website (www.nanologix.com) and to me it seemed like this product could not lose. Also the company's factory is in my hometown here in Ohio. I decided I wanted in after a story about the product in the local paper. I think it was $0.01 or $0.02 per share. Yes pennys at start up. 

After a year or so one day it shot up to $1.27 then fell back down to the bottom. I understand that the FDA has to approve their product and I understand that may take some time, but I am going on 9 or 10 years here lol. 

This week the company released a statement that a major study is beginning in Houston involving a group of doctors and lab's and it also involves the FDA. They also promised to publish the results of the study being done. 

Just on the article alone the volume picked up and it went up 16% in 1 day. I still hold 50,000 shares and I am sticking to my guns and not selling on little increases that happen every so often. I made my mind up long ago to hold the shares until the product goes global or the company goes bankrupt. I have so little invested that its not going to break the bank losing it. 

However after 9 years of holding the stock I dont really have any fear of losing. They are still trying after all this time to succeed and make this product fly. I still have faith this one is gonna go big. Is anyone familiar with this industry? How long could it possibly take for the FDA to give approval on a product like this?  Will another bigger company come along and want to purchase the patents and produce the product and if so what will happen to our shares?

Next week, Bank of Montreal, Bank of Nova Scotia and National Bank of Canada will report their respective results, with Toronto-Dominion Bank closing the reporting season on Aug. 30.

Royal Bank (RY) came out with quarterly earnings of $1.66 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.62 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.41 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 2.47%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this bank would post earnings of $1.62 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.65, delivering a surprise of 1.85%.

Add in stronger growth from the U.S. operations of BMO and TD, in particular, and Mr. Mihelic sees the banks reporting average overall earnings growth of 10 per cent, year over year, which is slightly better than the consensus.

FOR TRADING August 23rd
Retail Rules the Day
 
The market started on the downside after overnight futures were weak, but nowhere near the lows on the Trump news.  Before I went to sleep around midnight the S&amp;P e-minis were down about 17 but by the open it was closer to -5.  Almost from the start the DJIA was the weak sister, and as has been the case recently the bigger the index the better it did.  The low on DJIA was -100 and it closed -88.69 (.34%), S&amp;P 500 -1.14 (.04%), NASDAQ +29.93 (.38%) DJ Transports -114.12 (1%), and the Russell +4.50 (.26%).  Internals on the DJIA were 22 down and 8 up with the bulk of the loss today centered in BA -27 DOW pts., UTX -19, TRV -16, and MMM -10.  The overall internals on NYSE were essentially even with volume 1:1, A/D 14:13, but new highs were 4:1.  NASDAW was much stronger with volume 2:1, A/D 3:2, and new highs 7:1.
 
SECTORS:
 
Other names in the news, the big news were more beats by retailers with TGT the star today finishing +2.67 (3.2%) after being lifted as much as $5.50, URBN also beat but got none of the love and with 4 upgrades based on the beats traded up to $52.50 finished $45.48 -2.26 (4.73%), SMRT (Stein Mart) reported a smaller loss and solid full year projections but traded from $3.19 down to $2.58 -.46 (16%), and last in the retail list was WSM, up from $58 this week is trading $68.45 +5.83 (9.3%). Also in the news was EXAS, maker of the non-invasive Cologuard test that it is in an agreement to market the product with Pfizer.  It closed +15.27 (30.5%).  This was a $6 stock 2 years ago.

Last night I said that I want to see some horizontal trading before making a commitment to the long side again, but today’s action was dramatic.   I will still have to stand aside since to get long offers no reasonable stop if I’m wrong, and I don’t want to get short a strong market.  There is still meaningful supply between here and $70.40.
 

There is also a solid downtrend to contend with.  I’m still “sit and watch.”
 
The stocks were HIGHER with CVX +.86, APC +1.01, BP +.61, COP +1.11, APA +.83, PSX +.51, MCP +1.20, MRO +.74, RIG +.33, OAS +.52, HES +1.79, NE +.25, OXY +.44, XOM +1.13 and XLE +.96 (1.31%).
 
 
METALS, $1,203.30 +3.30 the gold failed to hold the round number of $1,200 and has traded as low as $1,167 before its current 4-day rally.  This prior support now becomes resistance and until we can rally AND CLOSE over $1,225 – 1,240. Copper collapsed to contract lows of $2.55 and it has broken all support going back to May 2017 at $2.50, and it too has tried for a couple of days to rally back into the break-down. We’ll need better economic numbers to get it started back to the upside.
 
BITCOIN closed $6,287 +230. After trading down to below test support at 6,800 we collapsed again hitting $6,110 before a minor rally to trade 6,615.  Tuesday’s low of $5855 is just $100 above contract lows of $5,755 could easily be breached and the overhead supply is still from 6,900 to 7,300.  Today we rallied as high as 6,880 and couldn’t hold and finished closer to the lows of the day.  I believe we will test at least $6,000 shortly.
 
Tomorrow is another day.

FOR TRADING August 21st
DJ Transports lead the Way!
 
The market started on the upside and spent the day working a bit higher.  NASDAQ was the weak sister at the open and while other markets were rallying it spent the first couple of hours trading lower.  Around 12:30 it finally went positive and although not on the highs, managed a close of +$4.68 (.06%), while the rest of the indexes were DJIA +89.37 (.35%), S&amp;P 500 +6.92 (.24%), the Russell +5.75 (.34%) and DJ Transports, the best performer +134 (1.19%).  Market internals were solid without being excessive with NYSE volume and A/D both 2.5:1 and NASDAQ just slightly less aggressive at 2:1 and 9:5 respectively.  The standout stat was new highs / new lows where the NYSE came in the big winner at over 6:1 while over at NASDAQ they were 2:1.
 
SECTORS:
 
Other names in the news, premarket we had the announcement of PEP buying SODA as its new entry into the bottled carbonated water paying $3.2 billion or $144/share.  This was just about 10% premium but don’t feel bad for holders since when the rumors surfaced 3 weeks ago the stock was just $85 so the real gains were closer to 70%.  In other news NKE got several upgrades based on solid inventory controls and more B to C sales (with much better margins) and finished the day +2.43 (3.05%).  TSLA took a pounding based on another interview that suggests the Elon Musk take a “medical leave” for a while.  The stock broke to $287 from its high just 9 days ago at $387, but managed to reverse its 6% loss from Friday’s close to manage a gain of 2.94 at the close.  A small name, SSC, a Chinese block-chain company got a contract to finance $24 billion to upgrade the buses from diesel to electric.  I have no clue how this works, but the stock closed $1.97 Friday and was trading $4.18 premarket and finished the day $3.02 at the lows but still +1.05 (53.3%).  Lastly, LCI, maker of several generic drug products received notice that it will not have its agreement with its main distribution partner, Jerome Stevens renewed in March 2019.  It was down early and at the close was $5.35 – 8.15 (60.3%).
 
 
 
BIO/PHARMA, today they were MIXED with CELG +.51, BIIB -1.11, REGN +.54, ISRG +.44, ABBV -.29, MYL +.26, TEVA +1.43 (5.9%), PRGO +2.54 (3.48%), GILD -.68, VRTX -.92, BHC +.35, INCY +.25, ICPT -.04, INNT +.01 and IBB -.20 (.17%).
 
RETAIL was MOSTLY HIGHER as earnings for several are due tomorrow.  Today’s upgrades for LULU caused quite a stir and sent the yoga / casual clothing company +6.48 (5%) and with NKE’s upgrades this morning sent the rest of the brands flying, with RL +3.50, UAA +.75(3.6%), KORS +1.97, GPS +.89, ANF +.65, URBN +1.10 and drove the stores higher with M +2.08 (5.7%), JWN +2.51 (4.24%), KSS +2.47 (3.23%), DDS +2.57 (3.45%), WMT -1.77, HD +2.11, TJX +1.62, TGT+.46, and DKS +.70.  My two favorite terminal retailers were both down with SHLD -.08 (5.7%) and JCP-.12 (6.7%) while the retailer ETF was XRT +.73 (1.43%).
 
FAANG, surprisingly the group was MIXED today with AAPL making a new all-time high this morning @ $219.18 before closing lower on the day @ $215.45 -2.12The rest of the list was GOOGL +6.10, AMZN -5.82, FB -1.15, NVDA +2.72, TSLA +1.75, NFLX (its first solid day in a while) +11.55 (3.6%), BIDU +.93, BABA +3.32, IBM +.45, BOX +.73 (we bought the 9/27 calls @ $1.15 today and they closed $.94 +.21) and XLK +.07 (.10%).
 
FINANCIALS, were HIGHER even with the weakness in interest rates with GS +2.40, JPM -.35, BAC +.11, AIG +.47, C +.81, PNC +.33, WFC +.17 and XLF +.06 (.21%).
 
OIL, $65.42 +.21 Oil was rocked by supply and drawdown numbers last week but after probing the lows for the past few day managed to bounce and spend some time defining the trading range.  I have said that I want to see some horizontal trading before making a commitment to the long side again.  The stocks were HIGHER with the exception of CVX, down just .05.  all the others I follow were up and the XLE +.43 (.59%).
 
 
METALS, $1,194.60 +10.80 the gold failed to hold the round number of $1,200.  This was partially due to the technical but also the fact that like Oil, it is an international commodity priced in the rising US$.  Last Wednesday night the pajama traders took it as low as $1,167 -18 before it came back early Thursday morning.  The action last night and the follow thru today are just part of what I’ll need to see before going back into this one on the long side.  Copper collapsed to contract lows of $2.55 and it has broken all support going back to May 2017 at $2.50, and I’ll need to see more than an anemic rally. We’ll need better economic numbers to get it started back to the upside.
 
BITCOIN closed $6,452 -20. After trading down to below test support at 6,800 we collapsed again hitting $6,110 before a minor rally to trade 6,615.  Tuesday’s low of $5855 is just $100 above contract lows of $5,755 could easily be breached and the overhead supply is still from 6,900 to 7,300.  Today was another narrow “inside day” that I feel will send us down again to test the lows.
 
Tomorrow is another day.

"The S&amp;P 500 is approaching its all-time highs on the back of good earnings reports from the Trump tax cuts. Investors have been rewarding companies that beat revenue expectations, while companies that miss expected revenues are being sold. 

This makes sense because nearly every company should have better earnings from the tax-cuts, but higher than expected revenues mean the company is winning demand from consumers. 

## Trouble Ahead?

However, as the market approaches this key level, we are seeing warning signs form. On the charts, the major indices show weakening momentum in the MACD, RSI, and MFI indicators. The bearish divergences in these indicators tell us the indices are lacking the strength to continue much higher.

Inside the S&amp;P 500, we see investors are positioning themselves defensively. The defensive sectors have been out performing the broader market over the last few weeks. 

This is a sign that investors are worried about the future of the stock market. Investors tend to buy these sectors because they tend to out perform during downturns and volatility. Defensive positioning coupled with weakening momentum warns us that there is volatility ahead. 

Right now, our main priority is to try and manage the expected volatility. We have raised cash, tightened our stops, and opened a long VIX position. This preparation should help us if the stock market starts to fall, like it did in January/February this year. 

Although we are expecting volatility, we still want to be prepared to invest near the bottom. We will do this by looking for stocks that have reached a significant support around the same time as the S&amp;P 500. The index has about 5.5% to fall to reach that critical support along the uptrend line. 

We have provided five stocks on our watch list. The first three are for breakouts. Breakout stocks are a good fit during this climate because they require conviction in order to breakout. When a stock breaks out, we can assume that investors expect the stock to continue climbing, even if the market as a whole behaves differently.

The other two stocks are provided in the event the S&amp;P 500 does fall the 5.5% to the trend line. We will be looking for these stocks to behave in the same way. We will look to purchase these stocks when they also fall to their trend lines. 

## LYB 

This industrial stock is in a symmetrical triangle. The company is a worldwide chemical producer, and has a trailing P/E ratio of only 8.45. 

A positive breakout from this stock could indicate that trade fears are relaxing, and the industrial sector as a whole is making a comeback.  

## CF

 We are putting CF back on our buy list because we sold it to raise cash in our portfolio. The stock is part of the materials sector, which has been under performing, but it has been an outlier as the stock has performed much better than the sector.  

## HPQ

 This technology stock is in an ascending triangle, and is currently sitting near the resistance line.   

## JPM

We are adding JP Morgan back onto our buy list but as a way to prepare for a rebound after the expected bout of volatility. We will look to buy the stock near its $105 support after we see signs of it bouncing up.   

## ATVI

 Lastly, we are watching ATVI. This gaming company has had quite the rise over the last few years, but now it is facing some downwards momentum. We will be watching this stock to fall back towards its long term trend line before buying.   

## Conclusion

Overall, we do not expect the market to fall into a bear market. The current sector rotation tells us that short-term volatility is likely to hit the market, but over the long-term, the cyclical sectors are still in control. We will continue to monitor the sector rotation for more clues into the future of the US stock market.

I will not have a new watchlist this week because I am moving across the country this week, please forgive me. Expect one next week and to hit the ground running then! But for now, here is an update on my watchlist.

1. ATVI = slipped below that 200 MA of 69.85, will wait for reclamation of that area to jump in. Quarters 3/4 are usually the strongest for this company so don't be surprised if this has a nice rally towards the end of the year. Keep this one on watch. 
2. CGC = was struggling around that 50MA, and we saw two red days before \[[https://finance.yahoo.com/m/db18f06e-0c05-3415-8f94-85cb4f6a2aa0/cannabis-company-canopy.html?.tsrc=rss](https://finance.yahoo.com/m/db18f06e-0c05-3415-8f94-85cb4f6a2aa0/cannabis-company-canopy.html?.tsrc=rss)\](this news)  hit. For now, I will be watching to see if we can get another breakout above 37, and then a retest of that resistance to be support (probably gonna take some time on this one). If you are interested in marijuana stocks check out the ETFs, i do think they will be the better play in the long run. 
3. BIDU = had a nice bounce right off that support line, and this is my top watch next week. I think the Chinese market will bounce back, and BIDU very well could lead the way. I think that the google hype is an over-reaction for now, because it would take years for this competition to take affect. This is a strong stock, that is being beaten down by the trade war/chinese economy right now. Keep this on high watch. (remember there is no such thing as an ""expensive"" stock.)
4. TEAM = stilling waiting for that breakout, looking like a possible flag forming, but i would just watch this one for now. 

Hope you all enjoy the update, and next sunday I will have another brand new post with new tickers to watch. This week is gonna be hectic for me.

[Tesla Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/TSLA:US) plunged Friday after [Elon Musk](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/id/1954518) told the New York Times that no one saw or reviewed his tweet about the plan to take the company private before he posted it. The billionaire frequently teared up in an interview and discussed the personal strain of leading the electric-car maker, the newspaper said.

Musk, Tesla’s chief executive officer and chairman, told the Times that he typed the take-private tweet as he drove himself to the airport on Aug. 7. The tweet said: “Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.”

The stock was nowhere near that price on Friday as it tumbled as much as 8.9 percent, the most since March in intraday trading, pushing the shares close to $300. The fourth straight day of declines has wiped out Tesla’s year-to-date gains.

In an hourlong [sit-down](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/PDLD4Q6JTSEB) with the newspaper, Musk also detailed his frequent use of the sleep-aid Ambien -- a drug he’s discussed using before, and whose well-known side effects include sleepwalking. “It is often a choice of no sleep or Ambien,” he told the newspaper.

Rather than put him to sleep, the drug has sometimes led Musk to spend his nights on Twitter, worrying some board members, the newspaper said, citing a person familiar with the board’s thinking.

### Mounting Scrutiny

The going-private tweet has set off a firestorm, causing the stock to jump but also prompting mounting scrutiny, including a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation.

Almost a week later, the CEO [said](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-13/musk-says-saudi-interest-sparked-effort-to-take-tesla-private) the basis for that statement were conversations with Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, which first expressed interest in helping take the company private in early 2017. Tesla’s board has since clarified that it hasn’t received a formal proposal from Musk, nor has it concluded whether going private would be advisable or feasible. This week, Musk was said to have [received](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-15/tesla-drops-on-report-of-sec-subpoena-over-musk-go-private-plan) a subpoena for more information, according to a person familiar with the matter.

[See also: Musk’s winding road to taking Tesla private](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-16/a-timeline-of-tesla-s-epic-go-private-saga)

One funding possibility being considered for the potential privatization is for Musk’s rocket company SpaceX to help bankroll the deal and take a stake in Tesla, the New York Times said, citing people familiar with the matter.

Efforts are also under way to recruit an executive to take some pressure off Musk, the newspaper said, citing people briefed on the search. A couple of years ago, Tesla approached Facebook Inc. executive Sheryl Sandberg about the job, Musk told the newspaper, but added that no active search is taking place currently “to the best of my knowledge.”

“If you have anyone who can do a better job, please let me know,” Musk told the Times. “They can have the job.”

Despite the frenzy over Tesla’s future, production of the pivotal Model 3 sedan -- which has frequently kept Musk at the Fremont factory overnight -- is defying the odds and going [well](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-16/tesla-model-3-production-s-just-fine-as-bernstein-bumps-price), according to Evercore ISI analysts. Output is well on track for weekly production goals, and set for a significant boost, the analysts wrote Thursday after touring the plant.

[Click here to see how many Model 3s Tesla is making at its Fremont plant](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-tesla-tracker/)

In the interview, Musk said he had sacrificed family milestones in the race to meet Tesla production targets, nearly missing his brother’s wedding where he was best man. Friends had approached him with concerns about his well-being, the New York Times said.

He called the period “excruciating,” the newspaper reported. “This past year has been the most difficult and painful year of my career.”

Musk told the newspaper that he didn’t recall communications from the board at all and that he “definitely did not get calls from irate directors.” He later amended the comment through a spokeswoman, saying lead independent director Antonio Gracias had contacted him about the Aug. 7 tweet. Musk agreed not to tweet again on the possible privatization without discussing it with the board, the spokeswoman said.",Tesla Tumbles After Tearful Musk Tells NYT Nobody Reviewed Tweet,StockMarket,1

President Donald Trump brought a long-simmering debate on Wall Street to the surface Friday when he prodded regulators to look into scaling back how often publicly traded companies report financial results.

Trump’s proposal -- released via Twitter and prompted, he said, by a recent conversation he had with PepsiCo Inc. Chief Executive Officer Indra Nooyi -- would do away with quarterly reports and move to a semi-annual system.

To those across the investing community who favor such an idea, it’s just what’s needed to reduce corporate costs, boost a flagging IPO market and get companies to move away from the sort of short-term focus that can harm long-term growth. To its detractors, it is, in the words of Hilton Capital Management’s Dick Bove, “a horrible idea.”

It would be a “major move to provide less information” at a time when investors’ access to information has “already been dramatically reduced,” Bove said.

However feasible or likely the plan is, the tweet does represent the sort of business-minded approach that corporate America hoped it would get from having a former executive in the White House. While Trump’s tax cuts and deregulation push have long earned their favor -- and Friday’s proposal can be seen as part of that effort -- he has also befuddled much of the business community by dragging the country into multiple trade feuds and by jawboning companies via Twitter.

Nooyi raised the issue while dining last week with Trump at his golf club in Bedminster, N.J., according to a person familiar with the discussion.

Many market participants “have been discussing how to better orient corporations to have a more long-term view,"" Nooyi said in an emailed statement Friday. ""My comments were made in that broader context, and included a suggestion to explore the harmonization of the European system and the U.S. system of financial reporting. In the end, all companies have to balance short-term and long-term performance.""

The discussion with Pepsi’s CEO wasn’t the first time White House officials have heard from the business community about quarterly reporting requirements. Other corporate leaders have raised the issue with White House officials, and the administration has been considering the issue for some time. The president’s economic team was also aware that well-known chief executives, including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.’s Jamie Dimon, have publicly advocated for companies to stop offering quarterly profit forecasts.

### Other Countries

The issue of the regulatory burdens of being a public company has recently taken center stage in part because Elon Musk used it as a rationale when he tweeted about taking Tesla Inc. private.

The change, if enacted, would have the U.S. following other countries in reducing the frequency of reporting requirements.

In Europe, companies and regulators in recent years have backed away from requiring quarterly financial statements. The European Commission adopted a rule in 2013 ending such a mandate. Japan gradually moved from bi-annual to quarterly reporting during the 2000s.

### The Cons

A top criticism is that companies are less likely to invest in their businesses if they are pressed to show profit gains every quarter.

Jim Dunn, CEO of Verger Capital Management, which oversees $1.7 billion for nonprofit investors including Wake Forest University’s endowment, said “short-termism is a real problem, from endowment returns measured annually, to stocks moving on quarterly earnings estimates.”

For buyers and sellers of stock, the change could encourage more thoughtful investing.

“Hedge funds that are obsessed with quarterly results are in fact speculating and not investing,” Dev Kantesaria, portfolio manager and founder of Valley Forge Capital, a Wayne, Pennsylvania-based equity hedge fund with about $340 million in assets.

There are many potential downsides, including the prospect that fewer financial reports could encourage insider trading and exacerbate volatility around earnings.

“You have such a long dark period where there is no information going out to the public,” said Robert Pozen, senior lecturer at MIT Sloan School of Management and former vice chairman of Fidelity Investments. “You’re dramatically increasing the temptation for people to trade” on inside information, he said.

While the quarterly earnings season has a negligible impact on market-wide volume, it does coincide with an increase in price turbulence among individual companies. Using Bloomberg data that looks at 10-day volatility in single stocks since 2010, price swings during the four reporting periods are roughly 10 percent higher than in the rest of the year.

The SEC has been reticent to make any changes in quarterly financial reporting, which has long been a cornerstone of U.S. capital markets.

SEC Chairman Jay Clayton, a Trump nominee, has said increasing the number of public companies and initial public offerings are among his top priorities. Still, Clayton hasn’t floated reducing the number of times that companies must disclose their financial performance each year.

The agency could make such a change on its own without Congress passing legislation but that doesn’t mean it will, said David Martin, who previously ran the agency unit that oversees corporate filings.

The SEC enjoys some level of distance from the White House because it’s an independent agency. It’s rare for presidents to make public demands of such regulators. SEC spokesmen didn’t respond to requests for comment.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other lobbying groups have blamed compliance burdens for preventing more companies from selling shares. A statistic they often point to is the drop in IPOs over the past 20 years. In 1996, almost 950 companies went public, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That number fell to 237 in 2017.

Tom Quaadman, executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness, pressed the SEC for reforms that would address short-termism.

""We would welcome an overhaul of the 1930s-era disclosure system that is not user-friendly and no longer meets the needs of a 21st century economy,"" he said.",Trump Ignites Wall Street Debate With Tweet on Redoing Earnings,StockMarket,1

Retail Revival with WalMart
 
 
The market started on the upside and never looked back.  The aforementioned WMT was clearly the star of the day opening at $100 +9.88 (10.8%).  Along with the new “trade talks” the market went unencumbered to finish +396.32 (1.58%), NASDAQ +32.40 (.42%), S&amp;P 500 +22.32 (.79%), The Russell +15.09 (.90%), and the DJ Transports +75.41 (.68%).  Market internals were stilted in the direction of the DJIA with the top 6 gainers were BA +96, WMT +57, CAT +29, GS +25, AAPL +21 and UNH +17 for a 6 stock total of 245 Dow points.  The index’s internals were 9:1 up with only 3 losers.  So, the NYSE outperformed NASDAQ with volume of 2.5:1 and A/D 3:1 vs. 5:4 and 2.6:1 respectively.  
 
SECTORS:
 
Other names in the news, yesterday’s ugliness was lain at the feet of M, and today’s monster rally was based on Retail.  WMT beat and as mentioned above spent the day hovering around $100 closing the day $98.64 +8.42 (9.33%).  It bears mentioning here that a company with a $300Billion market cap is not easily moved by 9% in either direction.  Volume today was 43MM.  Other retail names reporting today were JCP with a widening loss and several downgrades finished $1.76-.65 (27%), JWN with a beat and after trading $60 +8 is now 57.61 +5.31 (10.15%), DDS beat expectations but was still a loss and traded 69.88 at the low, down from 94 3 days ago but the last is 76.20 -7.18 (8,65%).  Away from retail, tech stocks were also soft with NVDA beating top and bottom lines but gave poor guidance and is trading $244.50 -12.94 (5.4%), AMAT also beat but gave poor guidance and is trading $45.40 -2.03 (4.3%).
 
BIO/PHARMA, today they were HIGHER with CELG +.95, BIIB +2.21, REGN +10.65 (2.94%), ISRG +1.13, ABBV +1.30, MYL +.08, TEVA +1.77 (its generic Epipen coming to market and approved by the FDA today), PRGO +.96, GILD +.81, VRTX +1.96, BHC +.81, INCY +.98, ICPT +1.01, INNT +.32 (6.35%) and IBB +.89 (.77%).
 
RETAIL was MOSTLY HIGHER as mentioned above with M +.71, JWN +4.89, KSS +1.81, DDS -6.98 (8.4%), SHLD (clearly terminal) -.35 (8.5%), JCP -.62 (26%), WMT +8.35, HD +1.02, TJX +1.01, TGT +1.41, DKS +.20 and the brands, RL +.69, UAA +.33, LULU +3.02 (2.4%), NKE +.25, KORS +.18, and XRT +.17(.34%).
 
FAANG, surprisingly the group was MIXED today with the exception of AAPL +2.76 (to another new high +1.31%) GOOGL -9.22, AMZN +4.38 but almost $20 off its high, FB -4.93, NVDA -13.76 (5.4%), TSLA -3.31, NFLX -4.77, IBM +1.11, BOX +.35 (we bought the 9/27 calls @ $1.15 today and they closed $1.05) and XLK +.32 (.44%).
 
FINANCIALS, were HIGHER with GS +3.75, JPM +.97, BAC +.36, AIG +.36, C +.95, PNC +2.45, WFC +.47, and XLF +.37 (1.33%).
 
OIL, $65.46 +.45 Oil was rocked by supply and drawdown numbers yesterday but after hitting a slight new low but closed near the high of the day. Clearly, this makes me wrong about not closing under $66.  The next area of support comes in between $63-64, but I wouldn’t be surprised to see a rally on the slightest geopolitical tension.  The stocks were MIXED to HIGHER with XLE +.58 (.81%).
 
 
METALS, $1,184 – 1.00 the gold failed to hold the round number of $1,200.  This was partially due to the technical but also the fact that like Oil, it is an international commodity priced in the rising US$.  Last night the pajama traders took it as low as $1,167 -18 before it came back early this morning.  Copper collapsed yesterday closing $2.56 -.1220, but bounced back to close $2.6165 + .0565.  It has broken all support going back to May 2017 at $2.50 to about $2.30. We’ll need better economic numbers to get it started back to the upside.
 
BITCOIN closed $6,405 +30. After trading down to below test support at 6,800 we collapsed again hitting $6,110 before a minor rally to trade 6,615.  Tuesday’s low of $5855 is just $100 above contract lows of $5,755 could easily be breached and the overhead supply is still from 6,900 to 7,300.  Today was an “inside day”.  According to the CNBC talking head who is the Bitcoin “expert,” today’s action is contract expiration related and there should be a rally for the next days.
 
Tomorrow is another day.

Even if you don't play chess, you can still appreciate the significance of this chess game between Googles new machine learning AI program, known as ""AlphaZero"", and Stockfish, which up until this point, was the strongest chess computer in the world.  Stockfish is a classical computer, where millions of games are programmed into the software.  It weights certain positions by a point system, and calculates via a brute force method, going through 100's of millions of positions, then picking the right one.   As a chess player myself, playing Stockfish is futile, as even the most minute positional mistake will lead to an outright frontal assault on your king, or a loss of a piece 10 moves later. You'd think Stockfish would at least put up a fight, but what resulted shocked the chess and computer world.  Not only did AlphaZero win decisively, but out of 100 games, Stockfish couldn't even win once.  It was like watching a novice chess player playing a grandmaster, with AlphaZero making ridiculous sacrifices for seemingly dubious positional advantages, where 20 moves down the road, AlphaZero would end up with the better position.  It was like Skynet on a chessboard.  To make a sacrifice against a chess computer, even one, is a feat in it's own right, but it seemed like every other move was a ridiculously long line of 100's of different lines branching into 100's more.  Almost every move included some kind of sacrifice.  

You can almost feel like there is a human like intuitive discernment happening, like there is a person, and not just some robot, moving the pieces.  It doesn't need to calculate as many positions like Stockfish because it sees a bigger picture that Stockfish is incapable of understanding.  AlphaZero has a  cohesion of thought that results in original insight, which you see in this game.  It's like AlphaZero has a spacial understanding of the game that seems almost human.  At times, it even seemed like AlphaZero was toying with Stockfish. 

I believe this spacial understanding, and intuitive calculation, rather than brute force tallying, is the future of stock algorithms.  Before these games, Google's AlphaGo beat the strongest Go player in the world, shocking the Go community.  At the time, many professional Go players thought it was impossible to create a program that could beat a human due to Go's intuitive requirements, something up until then at least, was believed to be unique to humans.  A few years ago, facebook had to shutdown it's AI algo because it created it's own language and was communicating with itself.  Machine learning is already inventing new ways of doing things, without needing any human guidance.   Is this really surprising though?  Remember the movie Demolition Man with Wesley Snipes and Sylvester Stallone.  The story was set in 2032, which back then was 40 years in the future, where people had flying cars and used seashell to wipe their ass.  Well, it's 2018 now, almost 2019.

Don’t look now, but on August 22, 2018, this current bull market will top the 1990s bull market as the longest ever. However, be aware that the 1990s bull market saw the S&amp;P 500 Index gain 417%, while the current bull market is up approximately 320%—so you can’t call this the greatest bull market…yet.

“Age is just a number,” explained LPL Research Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “The oldest man and woman in America are 112 and 113 years old, respectively; and the man smokes 12 cigars a day! Similarly, I think this bull market could surprise us and maybe last much longer than most think, particularly since we see few signs of smoke in the economy. In fact, the benefits of low inflation, strong corporate profits, and fiscal stimulus all suggest that this bull has plenty of tricks left up his sleeves.”

Elon Musk’s announcement about his advisers might be as squishy as his funding.

[Goldman Sachs Group Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GS:US) hadn’t been formally tapped as a financial adviser by [Tesla Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/TSLA:US)’s chief executive officer when Musk [revealed plans](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/PD3O0DAIBMDH)last week to take the automaker private and said he’d secured the funding for the transaction, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The bank still hadn’t officially signed on when Musk [said on Twitter](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-14/musk-working-with-silver-lake-goldman-to-take-tesla-private-jkt0o4sj) late Monday that he’s working with Goldman Sachs and private-equity firm Silver Lake as financial advisers, the people said.

Such a statement from a public company CEO typically signals a formal agreement. But Musk has shown a willingness to take an unusual approach, including tweeting last week that he had funding secured for a take-private deal. That declaration has prompted regulatory scrutiny and investor lawsuits.

Conversations are ongoing between Goldman Sachs and Musk, said the people, asking not to be identified as the information isn’t public.

### Informal Advice

Silver Lake appears to be in a similar situation. The technology-focused firm isn’t working for Musk in an official capacity as a financial adviser and isn’t being compensated as a consultant, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Instead, Tesla’s CEO is hoping to tap Silver Lake’s experience working on some of the biggest take-private transactions -- including Michael Dell’s $21.7 billion buyout of his namesake computer company and its subsequent $67 billion acquisition of EMC Corp. -- to help get a deal done, the person said.

Each of those transactions involved the firm making an equity commitment to help fund the deal. While Silver Lake hasn’t committed any financing to Musk’s possible buyout of Tesla, the firm hasn’t ruled out potentially making an investment at some point, the person said.

A spokesman for Goldman Sachs declined to comment. Representatives for Silver Lake and Tesla didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Musk’s latest tweet came just hours after he said Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund had first approached him about helping take Tesla private early last year, and that the fund’s interest gave him the confidence to state publicly that he was thinking about the move.

“I left the July 31st meeting with no question that a deal with the Saudi sovereign fund could be closed, and that it was just a matter of getting the process moving,” Musk [wrote](https://www.tesla.com/blog/update-taking-tesla-private) in a blog post Monday.

Tesla’s board is in the process of selecting financial advisers to evaluate Musk’s proposal. It has [formed a special committee](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-14/tesla-go-private-effort-advances-with-board-panel-to-study-offer), according to a statement Tuesday, which will take legal advice from Latham &amp; Watkins LLP and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &amp; Rosati.",Goldman Sachs Had No Mandate When Musk Tweeted,StockMarket,1

As the bizarre [Tesla Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/TSLA:US) go-private saga enters its ninth day, many investors are wondering when regulators will decide whether Elon Musk broke the rules by dripping out details so haphazardly.

History suggests it might take a while.

At the center of the Tesla controversy is what Musk meant when he tweeted Aug. 7 that he had secured funding for a buyout without providing any specifics to back up the claim. Almost a week later he said his confidence was based on conversations with a Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund, which had long expressed interest in taking the electric-carmaker private.

[Click here for a QuickTake on the SEC and Musk’s Tweet](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-07/can-elon-musk-tweet-that-the-sec-may-have-an-opinion-quicktake)

Securities lawyers have [said](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-13/musk-s-belated-explanation-is-unlikely-to-get-sec-off-his-back) Musk’s subsequent statement showed funding was anything but secure. So it’s an open-and-shut case of misleading investors that the SEC should be able to bring pretty quickly, right?

Not necessarily.

The SEC’s average inquiry takes about two years. That kind of time frame would understandably frustrate traders who are reading Musk’s [tweets](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-14/goldman-sachs-is-said-to-have-had-no-mandate-when-musk-tweeted) and trying to assess in real-time whether he’s actually lined up bankers and lawyers to advise on a deal. But even though Wall Street might want a quick ruling on whether he’s violated securities laws, Washington regulators may disappoint.

### Deliberative Process

The SEC is deliberative in gathering evidence to prove that executives knew their statements were false. In the Tesla matter that will probably lead to the agency trying to obtain emails, texts and phone records from Musk and the company. Attorneys representing Musk, Tesla’s founder and chief executive officer, would likely push back on some of the SEC’s requests. This back-and-forth can sometimes last weeks. From there, SEC attorneys will go through all the documents they’ve obtained to determine whom they should depose for questioning.

“I don’t think people understand the intensity of the investigation and the volume of documents and other types of evidence,” said Teresa Goody, founder and CEO of The Goody Group who previously worked as an attorney in the SEC’s general counsel office.

SEC officials may also be keen to speak with members of the Saudi wealth fund to learn if Musk’s public statements accurately reflect their private conversations. But getting foreign nationals to cooperate can be challenging, and issuing subpoenas to compel testimony doesn’t always work when the targets are overseas.

To be clear, the SEC hasn’t accused Musk or Tesla of any wrongdoing. If the SEC does determine he or the company violated the law, it will submit what’s known as a Wells notice, which notifies investigative targets that the agency’s enforcement division plans to recommend that SEC commissioners approve a lawsuit or sanction against the company.

### Defense Rebuttal

Defense attorneys typically get a chance to rebut a Wells notice, and if SEC officials think they have a point, they may opt to not bring a case. Final settlements that SEC commissioners vote on whether to approve are also heavily negotiated with defense lawyers, adding more time to the process.

Another factor that could slow things down is that the SEC’s scrutiny of Tesla goes beyond Musk’s recent tweets. The agency’s San Francisco office was already examining the company’s public pronouncements on manufacturing goals and sales targets, Bloomberg reported Aug. 9.

SEC spokeswoman Judith Burns declined to comment and a Tesla spokesman didn’t respond to a request for comment.

A sign of how long SEC probes can take is the Enron Corp. scandal, which is widely seen as one of the clearest examples of corporate wrongdoing ever. The SEC didn’t bring its first enforcement action until almost a year after Enron disclosed it was being investigated, and the case was filed about eight months on from the company’s bankruptcy filing.

### High Priority

Not everyone thinks the SEC-Musk tussle will go on for months and months. Stephen Crimmins, a former SEC enforcement lawyer, said Musk’s high-profile and the fact that his tweets have drawn so much attention will make the inquiry a priority for the regulator.

“The staff is going to want to expedite this,” said Crimmins, who’s now in private practice at Murphy &amp; McGonigle. “There’s a finite amount of information to gather, so it’s possible they could get it done in a couple of months.”

One question that could be near the top of Tesla shareholders’ minds is whether unwanted attention from the SEC might impact Musk’s ability to quickly take the company private. It certainly doesn’t help, said Joseph Grundfest, a former SEC commissioner.

""An active SEC investigation that, in my view, is likely to turn into an enforcement action is not going to make it easier to close this deal,"" said Grundfest, who’s now a professor at Stanford Law School. ""Musk is apparently thinking of an unprecedented structure that would have Tesla go private with equity-based funding, not debt. That would be hard to do without the additional risk of SEC enforcement action against Musk and Tesla.""",Investors Should Brace for a Drawn-Out Tussle Between Elon Musk and the SEC,StockMarket,1
"Hello everyone!

Posted this post also in another sub but it is all about the stock market. So you guys may be interested too. 

I've looked this monday into the European banks. At this day the European banks lost quitte a bit of value due to the drop of the Turkish lira. Before this drop the banks didn't perform well either. In the next document you can find a small investigation about the European banks. I've mainly looked towards the high dividend yields and the market. 

My English is not my native language and I am not a great writer too. I am sorry if there are many mistakes. 

While doing this research I had a bit of trouble making the investigation complete. The banking sector is a pretty huge one with lots of rules, risks and politics. The investigation is not really complete due to limited time and resources. I maybe am going to finish it further. But I feel now is a good moment to discuss European Banks.

Click [**here**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1krmxBqJYxDhcapsVOpjSev9d6oIiwYwQ/view?usp=sharing) for my document about European banks

Click [**here**](https://www.stoxx.com/index-details?symbol=SX7GT) for the Stoxx Banks Indices

What I want to know from you guys are the next points.

* What do you think about the (European) banking sector right now?
* Are the European banks valued attractively right now?
* Should the European Banking sector be avoided because of high risks?
* Do you think banks can compete against technologic disruptive forces?
* Do you know more about the southern banks like BBVA and SAN? (Their stock prices are even below the stock prices of 2009)
* … 

I haven't added a conclusion in my research yet because I feel it is not complete. My opinion about European banks is positive for the long term.  I believe the low stock prices of the banks are a good way to hedge you're portfolio against the high valued tech companies. The banking sector will not become a fast growing sector so you shouldn't expect fast money for it. Banks shall stay around for a long long time though. 

They invest in fintech to protect them from a disruptive future. They have more money than fintech companies alone. which makes them able to stay smart. Cryptocurrencies aren't forming a real threat with the new instant payment systems. Furthermore banks have more money and knowledge to compete against the cryptocurrency.

Tech companies like Facebook Amazon and Google can add banking activities. This would be a huge disruptive factor in the sector. But it is a pretty huge expensive and unlogic step for these companies. The bankingsector is hard to join because of the many rules banks are given. These companies need to create a lot of risks for the licenses and capital reserves etc joining a high competitive world with many huge players already in. If they succeed they become massive datamachines. Knowing everything about a person. These companies are already sensitive with their privacy policies, which will increase after adding banking information. 

Banks do have high risks. Bad economic events can bring the banks stock prices down further. The banks have a high dividend yield so you still have some dividend for compensation. 

Looking at the Stoxx banking index you see European Banks is already down more than 20% from it's high this year. The European banks only increased 66% after the big drop in 2009. 

This is a high difference with the Europe 50 index which grew up to more than 160% after 2009.

"# Warning: Bearish DD

So I made some DD recently, but I don't dare post it on WSB (they will call me a permabear and a fag) so I thought what the hell, I will post it to r/stonkmarket.

For the past nine years, the equities market has seen one of the best percent gains since the Bull Market of 1948-1969. Corporate taxes are low, GDP growth is strong, and joblessness well below the Natural Rate of Unemployment (NRU).

However, quite a few ratios, economic data, and past performances are pointing to the conclusion that this bull market is close to its conclusion. For all data, I will be using the S&amp;P 500 Index. Sorry Dow Jones and Nasdaq. Nobody loves you (well I love Nasdaq fuck Dow).

**Buffet Indicator**

Not to be confused with the Buffet Rule, the Buffet Indicator compares the Total Market Capitalization (Market Cap) of the stock market divided by the Total GDP.

|Ratio = Total Market Cap /  GDP|Valuation|
|:-|:-|
|Ratio &lt; 50%|Significantly Undervalued|
|50% &lt; Ratio &lt; 75%|Modestly Undervalued|
|75% &lt; Ratio &lt; 90%|Fair Valued|
|90% &lt; Ratio &lt; 115%|Modestly Overvalued|
|Ratio &gt; 115%|Significantly Overvalued|

As of 8/1/18, the Total Market Cap is 142.8% more than the total GDP. This indicates a significantly overvalued market. In 2000, one of the most notorious bubbles, the total market capped topped out at 148.5% of GDP. The 2009 lead up, had a top valuation of 110.7%. For the past 20 years, the market has reacted to an overvalued market by returning to a “Fairly Valued” TMC to GDP ratio. After the tech bubble burst, the market went from a high of 148.5% to a low of 75.2%, a decrease of almost half. With the current market approaching former tech bubble numbers, a bear market does not seem far off.

**Shiller P/E Ratio**

The Shiller P/E Ratio is a better measure of valuation than normal P/E. It accounts for the fluctuations of inflation due to the business cycle, therefore providing a more accurate picture of the true value of the security. Thankfully, there is a plethora of data surrounding the Shiller P/E ratio, all the way back to 1890.

Shiller P/E Ratio over the past 120\~ Years.

The grey bars mark U.S Recessions. Note 1929, 2001, and 2008.

MEAN: 16.9 (We are currently 53% above the mean, indicating an overvalued market.)

MIN: 4.78 (DEC 1920)

MAX: 44.19 (Dec 1999)

RANGE: 39.41

**Price To Sales (Revenue) Ratio**

The Price to Sales Ratio (PSR), like the P/E ratio, is a way of measuring value. Instead of comparing a company’s price to earnings, it compares a company’s stock price to its revenues.

|Price/Revenue Per Share|PSR Valuation|
|:-|:-|
|PSR= 0-1|Undervalued|
|PSR= 1-2|Fairly Valued|
|PSR= 2-3|Overvalued|
|PSR= 3+|Significantly Overvalued|

The current for the S&amp;P500 is 2.23, and at the height of the tech bubble, 2.44, indicating overvaluation. The chart below shows that until the late 90s, P/S never topped 1.3.

S&amp;P500 Price to Sales 1955-2006

S&amp;P 500 by Deciles 1986-Present

[https://imgur.com/a/vgHvy3j](https://imgur.com/a/vgHvy3j)

The graph above shows the S&amp;P grouped into deciles (each of ten equal groups into which a population can be divided according to the distribution of values of a particular variable (in this case Price to Sales Ratio)). Decile 10 shows that extreme speculation, especially in 2000, is centered on a fraction of stocks; in case of 2000 those stocks were tech. Currently, with the exception of Decile 10, the S&amp;P is the most overvalued it has ever been.

**Yield Curve**

Now we move away from the fun world of ratios and into the world of monetary policy. The Yield Curve is the curve of maturity and interest rates. It is a crucial market sentiment indicator about the future of the economy.

The normal yield curve shows that the shorter the maturity, the lower the yield.

[https://imgur.com/FLrnWJ4](https://imgur.com/FLrnWJ4)

The flat yield curve indicates a transition from an expansion to a downturn. Shorter maturities have the same yields as the

longer maturities.

[https://imgur.com/55oabKn](https://imgur.com/55oabKn)

The Inverted Yield Curve is a strong indicator of coming recession. Shorter maturities have higher yields than longer maturities.

[https://imgur.com/IqJsAOL](https://imgur.com/IqJsAOL)

We are currently in a flat yield curve.

**Bull Exhaustion** Bull exhaustion, a rapid rise in stock followed by a tail off called an exhaustion gap. Bull exhaustion is common during the peak of the bull market, and is a indication of a slowdown. This can be clearly seen in the correction in early February.

[https://imgur.com/b853lLx](https://imgur.com/b853lLx)

The failure of the market to recover to its previous high (it has been 6 months, and the S&amp;P hasn't recovered fully yet), combined with the low volume over the past few months, shows clear symptoms of Bull exhaustion.

**Dow Theory (the Public)**

Dow Theory is an one hundred year old theory about the stock market written by Charles H. Dow (the Dow in Dow Jones). While some of it isn’t relevant anymore (the reliance of railroads indicating trends) a lot of it still is relevant. The “Market Trends” part of Dow Theory is still particular relevant, especially in the realm of behavioral economics. Dow Theory states that there are three trends to the bull/bear cycle.

1. Accumulation Phase

a. In the beginning of the bull market “In the know” investors with a long-term outlook, and buy and hold.

2. Public Participation Phase

a. The Public and amateur investors join into the market. The uptrend becomes more obvious.

3. Distribution Phase

a. The final stage of the bull market. The “in the know” investors cash out, amateurs continue to join. Rampant speculation ensues. The market enters a downtrend. One of the trends I can definitely see today is the speculating public. Amateur “investors” through apps like Robinhood can now easily speculate with options and margin.

[https://imgur.com/pCIZCMl](https://imgur.com/pCIZCMl)

I believe we are in either late Public Participation Phase, or very early Distribution phase.

Anyway. Draw your own conclusions. This is my first DD. Feedback and criticism (pls dont call me fag) is welcome.

[Elon Musk](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/id/1954518) revealed that Saudi Arabia has long been interested in taking [Tesla Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/TSLA:US) private, which gave the him the confidence last week to drop the bombshell that he was considering the blockbuster potential deal.

Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund first approached Musk in early 2017 about taking Tesla off the market, he wrote in a [blog post](https://www.tesla.com/blog/update-taking-tesla-private) Monday. He confirmed the Public Investment Fund recently bought an almost 5 percent stake and is [interested in helping ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-12/saudi-fund-is-said-to-be-in-talks-to-invest-in-tesla-buyout-deal)take Tesla private, as Bloomberg News reported Sunday.

Musk described a meeting late last month in which a managing director for the fund expressed regret that such a transaction hadn’t moved forward. “I left the July 31st meeting with no question that a deal with the Saudi sovereign fund could be closed, and that it was just a matter of getting the process moving,” Musk wrote, adding that this is why he [tweeted](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/PD3O0DAIBMDH) on Tuesday that he had “funding secured” to take Tesla private at $420 a share.

The blog post is the latest in what’s been a piecemeal approach by Musk, 47, to explaining how he intends to pull off taking his money-losing electric-car maker private at a more than $70 billion market capitalization. The billionaire chairman and chief executive officer made no public mention of the Saudi fund’s involvement until Monday. Tesla’s board released a three-sentence-long [statement](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/PD584M3RXUKG) last week that only vaguely addressed how the transaction would be funded and didn’t bring up the kingdom’s potential role.

### Legal Scrutiny

Several investors have since [sued](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-12/musk-tweet-draws-tesla-investor-lawsuits-over-share-price-jump) Musk and Tesla, claiming the company’s share price was manipulated. The Securities and Exchange Commission is said to be [intensifying its scrutiny](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-09/tesla-is-said-to-face-broader-sec-scrutiny-over-musk-statements) of the company and its chief executive officer after having started gathering general information about Tesla and Musk’s earlier public pronouncements about manufacturing goals and sales targets.

One of Tesla’s biggest critics, Vertical Group analyst Gordon Johnson, read Musk’s blog post as walking back his “funding secured” claim last week. Johnson cited Musk’s statement Monday that the Saudi fund’s support for taking Tesla private was “subject to financial and other due diligence and their internal review process for obtaining approvals.”

“He is specifically stating that funding is not secured, and I think that’s a big deal,” Johnson, whose $93 price target for Tesla’s stock is the lowest among Wall Street analysts, said on Bloomberg Television. “The question then becomes, what does the SEC do here, and do the shareholders stick with him?”

### Question Answered

Tesla bull Gene Munster of Loup Ventures said the blog post “slightly increases” the odds that the company will be taken private. He cited Musk’s commentary and Bloomberg’s report on how the Saudi fund was interested in getting involved as part of the kingdom’s efforts to hedge against the world becoming less reliant on oil.  
“The question, ‘Where would the money come from?’ has been answered,” said Munster. He estimates a greater than 50 percent likelihood that Tesla will be private in a year, with Musk trying to limit investors like the Saudi fund to holding a stake of 20 percent or less, which would be in line with his holding in the company.

Tesla shares rose 0.7 percent to $358.03 as of 2:10 p.m. Monday in New York trading.

### Best Guesses

Musk wrote that he’s continued to communicate with the Saudi fund managing director, whom he didn’t identify by name. He said he’s reaching out to Tesla’s other [large shareholders](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/TSLA:US) and that most of the capital required to take the company private will be funded by equity, rather than debt.

“The $420 buyout price would only be used for Tesla shareholders who do not remain with our company if it is private,” he wrote, meaning that the actual capital needed to be raised would be “dramatically” less than $70 billion.

Musk said that his “best estimate right now” is that roughly two-thirds of the shares that Tesla’s current investors own would stick with a private Tesla.

After building that syndicate, Munster of Loup Ventures said that Tesla will need to create a vehicle for investors to “roll their public investment into a private one,” then obtain regulatory and shareholder approvals.

“Our best guess is this will take 3-9 months,” Munster said.",Musk Says ‘Funding Secured’ Claim Sparked by Saudi Meeting,StockMarket,1

"### Key Points

* Sector rotation analysis can provide insight into the current state of the stock market that other analysis can’t.
* Relative Rotation analysis shows investors are positioning themselves defensively as the S&amp;P 500 approaches new all-time highs.
* However, deeper analysis shows that this may be a short-term trend.

Sector rotation can tell us a lot about the stock market. It can give investors insights into trend performance and investor sentiment, but it also can tell investors where they should focus, or more importantly, which areas in the market to avoid.  

## What is Sector Rotation?

First, stocks/companies can be grouped into certain groups called sectors. These companies are usually in the same industry, and they cater to a specific part of the economy. Because they are in the same sector, often times they are direct competitors. 

Sector rotation is the idea that sectors move in and out of favor with investors; i.e., they rotate between under performance and out performance. This occurs because market participants drive stock returns, and when one sector is more in favor, it out performs. 

## What Can Sector Rotation Tell Us?

Stocks prices are based on the future expectation of performance. When investors believe a stock will be higher than it currently is, they purchase it. If they believe the stock will be lower, they sell it. This is what drives sector rotation.

During certain parts of the economic cycle, different sectors tend to perform better than others. For example, when the economy is growing in the middle of the cycle, investors should expect cyclical sectors like the industrials and materials sectors to outperform. 

The companies in these sectors are driving economic growth by creating and providing the necessary resources to produce the final goods and service for consumers. On the other side, when the economy is weakening, investors should look to the defensive sectors. 

These sectors are defensive because they are companies that provide essential services and products such as toilet paper or health care. Consumers need these products and services regardless of the strength of the economy. 

The cyclical sectors, or the sectors that should outperform during economic growth are the industrials, materials, financials, consumer discretionary, energy, and technology. The defensive sectors are the utilities, consumer staples, and health care. 

Sector rotation also tells us about investor sentiment. When we see that defensive sectors are outperforming, it tells us that investors are worried about the future. The defensive sectors tend to be less volatile during times of market volatility. When investors are bullish we see the the more volatile sectors rise faster, and investors position themselves in that way.

In the rest of this blog, we will use sector rotation analysis tools to determine the current state of the stock market, investor positioning, and what it all means. 

## Relative Rotation

The Relative Rotation Graph uses price action to determine sector performance compared to the S&amp;P 500. This graph literally shows how sectors are rotating in and out of favor.  

Currently materials, industrials and financials are in the lagging quadrant in the bottom left, while technology and energy are moving towards it. Consumer staples is the lone sector in the improving quadrant, while health care, utilities, and consumer discretionary are in the leading quadrant.

The current setup of the Relative Rotation Graph is a little concerning. The three defensive sectors are performing better than five cyclical sectors. Only consumer discretionary stocks are  in the top half of the graph, and even so, it is very close to moving into the weakening quadrant.

## Ratio Charts

These charts use a ratio to determine performance. an investor can put any two assets together to determine which is performing better relative to the other. This works by dividing one security by another. When the chart is moving up, it means the top security (as a fraction) is outperforming. 

When the chart is moving down, the bottom security is stronger. In our case, when the chart is moving up, it means the sector is performing better than the S&amp;P 500, and it is a positive for the index. When the chart moves down, the sector is lagging the S&amp;P 500, and it is detracting index performance. 

However, the most important thing about these charts is that we can use traditional technical analysis on them. 

## Cyclical Sectors

The technology and consumer discretionary sectors are the strongest performers. Technology has been leading the S&amp;P 500 since 2014, and has maintained this trend since. Mean while, the consumer discretionary sector has recently broken out of a sideways channel, which could be a sign of more longer-term out performance. 

The energy sector has been under performing since 2014, but it may have broken that trend, We will want to watch this chart to see if the out performance can continue.  

Industrial and materials stocks have been weak this year, as illustrated by their ratio charts. Materials has broken an upwards channel indicating future weaker performance. 

Industrials has remained above a support level, which is a good sign, but the ratio chart has failed to move up since the start of the year. However, since the ratio has remained above the support, we remain bullish on the sector.

## Defensive Sectors

 All three of the defensive sectors are in under performance down trends. Healthcare is trying to break that trend, so we will need to watch to see if it can find a new uptrend.   

## Conclusion

First, we looked at the Relative Rotation Graph. This told us that investors are positioning their portfolios defensively. In the short-term, investors have been buying more of the defensive sectors, which has pushed these stocks higher faster compared to the S&amp;P 500 and the other sectors. Meanwhile, the industrials, materials, and energy have been underperforming, as investors look for opportunities in the defensive sectors.

Second, we looked at the individual ratio charts. These charts show longer-term trends, and they help put the Relative Rotation Chart in perspective. These charts show the relative out performance of the defensive sectors is minor in a longer term perspective. 

While the defensive sector ratios have moved up over the last few weeks, the long-term trends show that technology, consumer discretionary, and the industrials are still in control over the long-term. 

However, it is not all clear skies. The materials sector continues to weaken, and financials are struggling. But these sectors could possibly be explained by the trade disputes in the global economy, and the fact that treasury yields have failed to move meaningfully higher.  

## What Does it Mean for the S&amp;P 500?

First, we need to point out that the S&amp;P 500 is approaching all-time highs. Defensive positioning as the market goes higher is a signal of something. Normally, we want to see the cyclical sectors take control at this point, in order to lead the index higher. Since this is not the case, it is probably a sign of future volatility.

I’m looking for some good weed stocks preferably Canadian. I know I missed out on the biggest profits which were a year ago but I recently turned 18 and was wondering if it’s too late to invest in them? Thanks ,Good Canadian cannabis stocks?,StockMarket,1
"**Week of , August 13th– Swing Trades Watchlist,** **Technical Analysis ONLY**

1.  **ATVI – ACTIVISION**  

o Saw a large drop after earnings report, beat on EPS, very possible an over-reaction (3 day rule), after the drop we saw it hit the 200SMA near 70$, with the dip under that MA being bought, with 2 consecutive green closes after. Good risk/reward in this area.

o Entry would be in the area that it is in now, 70-71, would be small, and would want to scale on the way up if the trend holds.

o Mental stop loss would be under that 200SMA around 69$ (maybe even a tad lower) so that you wouldn’t get shaken out by an MM sweep. If it goes under that 200SMA, I wouldn’t touch it, would wait to see where the floor is.

o Resistances to watch would be 73, 75 (65SMA), 76 (50MA), 80, and then watch for the high break of 82.

o Support to watch is only that 200MA, otherwise I would be a spectator. 

o Will keep this on high watch Monday morning to see what the market does, If I enter it would be SMALL and I would respect the stop loss/mental if it doesn’t work out. Plan your trade accordingly! 

**2.**  **CGC – CANOPY GROWTH**

o One of the many marijuana stocks trying to get a piece of the pie with the upcoming legalization in Canada this fall

o Was only watching this stock because it was getting close to reclaiming that 50SMA (28.75), however on Friday, it hit that 50MA and bounced off, and closed red. 

o Will watch to see what happens around that 50SMA, and ONLY take a position if it can break and hold that 50MA.

o If it were able to re-claim and hold that 50SMA, I would use that area as an entry, and a mental stop loss, similar to ATVI. This is ONLY if it can re-claim that 50SMA. Keep this on watch for the next couple weeks, could see a nice run if it can re-claim that 50SMA to the double top high of 36.50. 

**3.**  **BIDU – BAIDU (“GOOGLE OF CHINA”)**

o This is one of my favorite “expensive” (don’t like that word) stocks that I keep on my watch list. It is finally back in the buying range (look at the 1/2/3 year chart to understand the patterns).

o It is near that support of 220-215 that I have been watching for, played this last time in was in the 220s

o Has seen this drop because of the competition that GOOG could be bringing into China, which BIDU hasn’t faced before.

o Has strong support in the 215-220 range, where 216 was the previous resistance (zoom out and youll see). 

o This is gonna be a high watch for me this week to see what happens, if I enter it will be in this range that it is currently in, with a mental stop loss near the 210-205 range, which if it broke, would tell me that this move is done and it is going back to the old support/resistance (zoom out!).

o Really like the r/R here, potential 15$ loss, for a 60$ gain (resistance is 270-280 (ATH is 284), with a 4/1 ratio. 

**4.**  **TEAM – ATLASSIAN CORP**

o This stock has been a monster recently, up over 100% inless than a year, but don’t let that scare you!

o After the earnings beat, we saw the old resistance (69) obligterated, with the stock hitting a 52 week high of 79.82. 

o Since that we have seen a pullback back into that 69 resistance area, which was then converted into the support area. Therefore the trend is still in tact and I will be watching this closely.

o Ill be specifically watching to see if that 52 week high can be broken, currently at 78$, or if it cant be broken, watching for another pullback towards the 69$ range. 

o If it breaks that 52 week high, watch for the pullback back to the 79-80 range to see if that acts as support

o Most likely will not be entering a position this week, but I think this is a great stock to keep an eye on for the near future and what these next few weeks can bring us. Watch those sup/res levels closely. 

***Other Stocks I Will Be Watching***

o MTCH, DBX, SEND, ALRM, SAIL, CUTR, DOCU, YEXT, KEM, SHOP

What do you guys think about Twitter as an investment? As of now it’s 33.18 (12:35est. 8/13).  There seems to be a lot of optimism around the stock but also some shorts.

"This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

"These are the latest Schedule 13D forms filed by activist investors in the last 7 days. Activist
investors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.
There is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.
Schedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management
(such as Index funds).

There is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize
is that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.
The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.
In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

"Hi everyone! I’m very new here and to trading in general. I’ve been practicing for 2 weeks on Investopedia’s sim and have a little baby trading account on Fidelity to really get my feet wet. Yep, I’m super newbie ☺️ 

I am a stay-at-home mom (I care for a severely disabled adult son full time), but I’ve been looking for a way to generate any amount of income from home for a long time. I’m absolutely fascinated and somewhat obsessed with trading and everything about it. I study charts, read everything I can, and listen to podcasts and watch all the educational videos I can in a day’s time. I do this every day, all day ☺️I am in love with trading, LOL! 

Sorry for the long introduction 😊 I am just wondering how many people here trade for a living. I know this is a massive endeavor that will come with trials and errors but I’m ready and willing to take on the challenge.

"There are no ETF'S on the VIX Index itself. The only way you can trade the VIX Index is through options. 

There are many ETF'S that trade VIX futures.  VIX futures ETF'S do not track the VIX Index however.   They track the futures of the VIX which is much different.  

The problem with VIX futures ETF'S is there is a constant decay in their price.  They use other elements like contango and backwardation to determine their price and direction.

A lot of retail traders get sucked into trying to trade these VIX futures ETF'S like VXX, UVXY, and TVIX.  And a lot of traders lose money trying to trade these ETF'S. 

I personally am not a fan of the VIX futures ETF'S.  I feel they are only good for shorting when the VIX spikes.  I prefer to trade the VIX Index with options which is the only pure play on the Index itself.

Wall Street and Washington have the same question for [Elon Musk](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/id/1954518): Where’s the money?

Two days after he vowed on Twitter that he had “funding secured” for a spectacular $82 billion deal to take [Tesla Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/TSLA:US) private, he has offered no evidence to back up the statement. No one has stepped forward publicly -- or privately -- to say they’re behind the plan. People with or close to 15 financial institutions and technology firms who spoke on the condition of anonymity said they weren’t aware of financing having been locked in before Musk’s tweet.

All of which could be problematic as the [Securities and Exchange Commission](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/13165Z:US) starts investigating the matter. Regulators have asked the company if what Musk tweeted was factual and why such a disclosure was made via social media rather than in a filing, according to the Wall Street Journal, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter. Judith Burns, an SEC spokeswoman, declined to comment. Tesla also declined to comment.

“When Musk tweeted this, was he saying this was something that was definitely going to happen? Something that might happen?” said Ira Matetsky, a partner at Ganfer &amp; Shore in New York, outlining questions the SEC might ask. “How would a reasonable investor interpret that and was it consistent with the facts as they existed at the time?”

### ‘I Wish’

Tesla fell 0.8 percent to $367.50 in trading before U.S. exchanges opened Thursday -- well below the $420 at which Musk said shareholders would be bought out.

The chief executive officer raised the go-private possibility with the board last week, according to a [statement](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/PD584M3RXUKG) from six of Tesla’s nine directors. They said he had “addressed the funding for this to occur,” without providing details.

As for Tesla shareholders, Musk said in one of his Twitter posts that [“investor support is confirmed”](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/PD3VSGAIBMDC) for his plan. The largest shareholders declined to comment. At the California State Teachers’ Retirement System, which as of March owned about 213,000 shares, spokeswoman Michelle Mussuto said there was no advance warning.

“We have not been contacted by Tesla IR,” she said. “They didn’t reach out before the tweet either.”

Leaving the public marketplace isn’t a new vision for Musk, who told Rolling Stone in an interview [published](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/elon-musk-the-architect-of-tomorrow-120850/) in November, “I wish we could be private with Tesla. It actually makes us less efficient to be a public company.”

In April 2017, when Musk held talks with [Masayoshi Son](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/id/1455295) about [SoftBank Group Corp.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/9984:JP) investing in the electric carmaker, they touched on the possibility of fulfilling Musk’s wish, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions. The [talks](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-08/musk-is-said-to-have-talked-with-softbank-about-tesla-investment) failed to progress due to disagreements over ownership and have not started up again.",Musk Mystery Enters Day 3 as Pressure to Show the Money Mounts,StockMarket,1

"If you plan and to hold a your stocks until you die, invest in individual companies or be a trader, this is not useful. Lets get this clear, this is my opinion and most importantly it does not mean a particularly company is over valued it means I believe the market as a whole is overvalued.

1. Most basic point it. It has been over 10 years since we have had a real bear market. One is just kinda over due. And it has not like we have had the growth to justify it. The US economy has been slow to come back from 08, in comparison to other crashes. Not to say thats not understandable, 08 was much worse then other crashes, but the stock market has not reflected the lack luster growth.
2. Unnaturally low interest rates(and other underperforming assets) driving demand for US stocks. As you all know asset classes compete with each other.  People only have so much money to invest and if one class is giving good returns it draws capital to itself and away from other classes. US bonds have had low interest rates historically speaking. When 10 years are below 3%( which seems normal now) less investors are willing to buy, driving an increase demand for stocks. Furthermore, other stock markets have not been preforming very well. The ftse has only return 15% in the last 5 years. Shanghai comp is at 35% in 5 years.(not the best indicated as they had a MASSIVE bubble.) Dax and Nikkei have done better at 51 and 65% over 5 years. (S&amp;P returned \~68% which means Nikkei outperformed S&amp;P as yen is deflating while USD is inflating) Gold has not moved almost at all in 5 years. The only large asset class I see that has done pretty well is real estate, in certain areas( in some cities I think it has entered a bubble.) From what it seems to me most people are heavily into US equities as they are returning the best.
3. Cape ratio or the Cyclicly adjusted p/e ratio is a good way at judging what the average p/e on a stock is (in S&amp;P).

[http://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe/](http://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe/)

As you can see we are at a pretty high evaluation. Your really not getting the bang for your buck currently. This could be explained by amazon using a different model of never earning money and keeping a very high P/E. (I don't think NFLX is the same, I think they are just overvalued) However, I don't think that alone would change it a lot.

4) Things I do not know but would like to.

How the massive popularity ETF changes this.

How stock buybacks changes this. (Is this even new? I have heard more and more companies doing this but I don't know if its a new thing or just something that got popular again.)

In conclusion: Could the market go to a higher level from here? Yes. However, I think we have a greater chance of going into a bear market from this point.",Why I PERSONALLY Believe stocks to be overvalued.,StockMarket,1

"Hey all,

I'm creating this thread for tips / learning methods that you have personally used to gain a better understanding of the market. Anyway, to start the goodwill I will share how I've gained my knowledge to date.

Firstly, I cannot recommend more the book ""Principles"" by Ray Dalio. The first 200 pages or so are very insightful on what it takes to be successful in the market, and just how much you must take into account. If you don't wish to read the book you will not benefit to the extent I have, but here are some of my key takeaways: 

**Principles**

1. Always consider cause and effect relationships. The relationship of history, politics, and economics are very tightly related. 
2. History repeats itself. Dalio amassed his 160Bil management fund (Known as Bridgewater) through 30 years of trial and error. He developed a system to judge the risk factor of the market given previous exposures of the stock exchange. A proper understanding requires the analysis of all previous crashes, what/why/who/how it happened. 
3. Know the difference between Speculating and Investing. Most people are speculators and that is BAD. Don't throw money at something because you think its price will rise (Buffet also shares this thinking). Investing is throwing money at something because of its intrinsic value, its benefit to society, and its moat. 
4. Here's a fun example of the detail (although I'm just summarizing) that Dalio went through to understand the Soybean market. He began by studying average crop yields, yearly rainfall, average acreage of a farm, and identifying all the major states that farms are in. He then read about the usage of soybeans and their importance in the animal feed industry. So thus, the population of the cows and pigs (some main animals) are highly indicative of the demand for soybeans. He further read into birthing periods of these animals, mortality rates, and what years were most fertile. He also considered corn yields and how much they were farmed because they are often a substitute depending on price of soybeans. Dalio then analyzed these cause and effect relationships for select periods of time throughout US history. By the time he reached his conclusion on the movement of soybeans in the foreseeable future, he was wrong. Everything pointed to yes, and as a young investor he was arrogant and believed he couldn't be wrong. This just goes to show, never assume you're correct. Let logic and history guide you towards solutions. What can be taken away is that, if you DO speculate, you better damn well do some research. Research is not a quick google search, it's not listening to other Redditors (although I have anyway), but grinding a few hours or so to consider as many cause effect relationships, and then logically come to a conclusion. 
5. Don't give up. Dalio bankrupted hundreds of millions in his beginning, today Bridgewater (he retired last year) 160 Billion + dollars. 
6. Converse with other intelligent people, respectfully disagree with them and work logically and calmly to come to a more inclusive conclusion. You can't both be right, don't let ego get in the way. 

7. Act like an average investor, receive average results. Don't be a trend follower, don't invest because others do. 

8. Cash rules. 

\- If a company doesn't generate cash it won't stay alive (notice Tesla's Elon Musk is a genius of boosting his stock without actually profiting through his brash and bold statements, he has kept this up for a year now since he missed his production numbers by 200,000. He's been manipulating his stock trying to squeeze shorters for almost a full year. If you check the rolling averages you will see the year average is flat, kept afloat by his statements.) 

9. Invest in things you understand. If you don't understand biomedical or biotech, you probably shouldn't invest in it. You won't know what is truly beneficial or what its specialty is. You can only rely on interpretations of others (who probably tell you things so that you act how they want you to)

**Thing's I've noticed (and probably many others) about the market currently.** 

1. Anyone worth anything knows about the PE Ratio and how it relates the stock price to the intrinsic value of a company. Please visit: [http://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe/](http://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe/) for the history of market PE ratio since its inception. You will see the INSANE bubble the market is currently in. 
2. The Fed has not raised interest rates even though we are experiencing major inflation. This has been going on since 2009, and now the problem is most likely unfix-able (once again, you are never sure). If fed raises the interest rates in the near future to combat inflation, expect a negative reaction from the market, as this often shrinks the economy (which is a good thing, but bad for stock prices and public opinion). 
3. Warren Buffet currently has $110,000,000,000 sitting around in cash. I.E. he is not investing it because he knows the current state of the market is entirely overpriced. Don't pick up pennies in front of a steamroller. 
4. This China vs USA trade war is over-hyped for now. 32 billion in tariffs is really nothing in comparison to multi trillion dollar nations. It's media hype which is negatively affecting many of the stock sectors. However, thats not to say the farmers haven't been effected, as we are releasing care packages (giving them money) to sustain higher pricing. It is worth considering that China also has been in economic turmoil, and can't afford to push out any other business. They also don't import enough from the USA in order to match our tariffs to 300 billion. (feel free to argue which side you believe is in a better position. back it up with facts, quite frankly I think the discussion would require another thread)
5. Don't get your news from major media sites. If you rely on Fox, Cnn, MSNBC, or any other of those brainwashing channels, you must be naive to trust their market analysis when the other 23 hours of the day they are showing Kardashians or complaining about Trump. Some sites I use: 
   1. Zero Hedge
   2. Daily Observer (Bridgewater monthly economic condition report) If you read these articles you will understand just how deeply the big firms analyse market conditions.
   3. Seeking Alpha
   4. Bloomburg
   5. Kunstler
   6. Mishtalk
   7. (I will happily accept recommendations from y'all)

6. Learn how to properly read and analyse 10K filings and 10Q filings. This is a field I'm working on, I use [last10k.com](https://last10k.com) its pretty laggy, but its what I started with and I like it. I focus heavily on Consolidated Cash Flow Statements, and properly compare different quarters and years. I'm working (trying to find help) with creating a program which just grabs the info from companies of interest and throws it into an excel sheet so I can manipulate data and follow trends easier. 

7. Get comfortable with all the functions of your online brokerage (Charles Schwab, Etrade, Ameritrade, etc). Understand the fees involved with transactions and the risks you take on. 

8. Invest what you are willing to lose. 

9. Read. Read. Read. Read. Read. There is so much information out there, so many people have already made mistakes, you don't need to make the same ones. Learn from others, and better yourself. 

That's all that comes to mind for now. I'm happy to hear anything y'all have to offer and happy to listen to any refutes you have. At the end of the day, it's all about the money baby. ",Knowledge Share,StockMarket,1
"I'm adding $1800 to my portfolio and I'm deciding which stocks I should buy.

Two granted mining leases and three granted exploration licenses comprise a total of 146.80 km2 (the ""**Projects**""). The Yandicoogina Project includes \~4.7 km of prospective strike defined by structurally controlled quartz veins host to extensive historical gold workings. Significant rock chip samples within the Yandicoogina Project range up to 199.7 g/t Au. The Boodalyerrie Project is underlain by approximately 25 km2of sericite and silica altered granite with extensive quartz veining.

**Highlights of the Transaction:**

* Strategic portfolio of **2 granted mining leases** and **3 granted exploration licenses** (146.80 km2).
* Mining leases provide the potential for immediate large scale bulk sampling of mineralization. The 2 granted mining leases add to the 5 granted mining leases from the Friendly Creek transaction announced May 28, 2018.
* **2.3 km of strike of the contact between Hardey Formation and Mount Roe Basalt occurs within the Boodalyerrie Project.**
* **Considerable target size of Boodalyerrie Project due to being underlain by 25 km2** **of sericite and silica altered granite with extensive quartz veining. Historical high grade channel sampling including** **3 m** **at 88.6g/t Au and rock chips of up to 200g/t Au.**
* **Yandicoogina has multiple defined prospects with rock chip results of up to 199.7 g/t Au, high grade historical workings and cumulative prospective strike of 4.7 km.**

""*The acquisition of the Yandicoogina and Boodalyerrie Gold Projects provides a significant increase in the scale of exposure to the Pilbara region both in relation to conglomerate and structurally controlled gold systems. The high grade nature of structurally controlled gold mineralisation across an extensive strike length between the two Projects provides a compelling value proposition,""* **commented Alec Pismiris, Interim President and CEO of Pacton Gold.** *""We look forward to working closely with the Gardner team, as we commence the implementation of exploration programs across these particularly exciting projects.""*

**About Gardner Mining Team**

The director, management and associated consultants of Gardner Mining have extensive local operating history within the Pilbara region of Western Australia. The team is comprised of corporate finance executives, geologists, prospectors and mining executives, and has extensive ties to the local communities where it operates.

"As I’m sitting here eating my cereal this morning, I can’t stop thinking about Snapchat. It’s a company that has had reliably negative sentiment and coverage since its disappointing earnings release back in May, and has seen short interest increase about 2% over the last quarter (though you’ve seen short sellers button up positions over the past few days ahead of the release, partially explaining the little bump shares got yesterday). And why shouldn’t it have such negative coverage? The company stated back in May it was lowering its revenue growth guidance for the next quarter amidst slowing ad interest and user growth. Sounds like a dog with fleas, right?

Perhaps. Perhaps not. 

I don’t usually advise speculative trading because it’s usually unprofitable and highly risky. However, so long as you are comfortable losing all of it, and it’s a relatively small sum of money, I actually thinking $SNAP has a lot of short term upside potential. 

Whenever investor sentiment has become universally bullish or bearish on a particular company, you have to ask yourself whether the pendulum has swung too far. In $SNAP’s case, I think it has. Almost every reporter and analyst on the street is expecting a total bust this afternoon when Snapchat releases earnings for this quarter. That gives us a unique buying opportunity. 

We’ve seen other social media giants like $FB and $TWTR take big hits after earnings call this quarter as well. Both cited the newly implemented GDPR as one cause of the revenue slow down, but both also saw a great deal of criticism from users and lawmakers alike because of their roles in data privacy scandals and the Russian misinformation campaign. While Snapchat has not been totally immune to these critiques, or GDPR, the blow to user growth should be much more muted. 

In addition, with expectations so universally low, we really only need a victory at the margins for the sentiment to become positive enough for forward momentum. And there have been some developments to suggest that a an expectations beat is possible. 

For starters, Snapchat is finally in the process of completing its transition to automated advertising sales, a far more efficient process than the manual block ad buys before. Analysts only wanted to discuss a 70% drop in pricing (which really should be viewed positively), ignoring the massive growth in aggregate ad impressions. Advertising is the key here, because the company presents a better value proposition for exposure to millennials and centennials than $FB or $TWTR, both of which are already slowly becoming old news for kids (one survey found 79% of people 13-18 had Snapchat, compared to just over 53% for Facebook). Bringing on VP of finance Tim Stone from Amazon also can’t hurt. 

Don’t take just my word for it. Note 13F filings recording a more than 18% increase in institutional purchases of $SNAP on the open market, as well as more the than 800,000 net shares acquired by company insiders over the past three months. Offering lower guidance while picking up more shares on the cheap? Nice to know the company is bullish. 

In any case. I think $SNAP has some upside potential in the near term. Good trade if you’re willing to take the risk pre earnings, but this is no doubt a speculative move. Warren would not endorse, but you’re playing with house money after y’all burned me on the $TSLA short. 

Stack that paper lads.

"[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-06/forget-apple-goldman-says-flagging-new-1-trillion-for-s-p-500](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-06/forget-apple-goldman-says-flagging-new-1-trillion-for-s-p-500)

Investors fixated on one 13-digit milestone last week, Apple Inc.’s value. But another trillion-dollar threshold is in sight and is more relevant to the bull market in U.S. equities, says Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

It’s the volume of stock buybacks that corporate America is likely to announce this year. The total for S&amp;P 500 firms will jump 46 percent from 2017 to an annual record, according to an increased estimate from the Goldman unit that executes share repurchases for clients.

The new forecast highlights accelerating demand from companies, a sign that any weakness in stocks is likely to be met with unbridled corporate buying. While August has been one of scariest months of the year for equities in the past decade, it’s also the busiest in terms of buybacks, accounting for 13 percent of the annual total.

Now, with more than 80 percent of S&amp;P 500 members done with quarterly financial reporting, most companies can boost discretionary buybacks, concluding a blackout period that typically restricts share repurchases.

“Investors should focus on a different $1 trillion number that will have a key influence on the market: total buyback authorizations,” strategists led by David Kostin wrote in a note Friday. “It’s not the size of the company but the use of the cash that matters.”

With a year-end forecast of 2,850 for the S&amp;P 500, a level that’s less than 10 points above Friday’s close, Kostin is far from being the biggest bull among [Wall Street strategists](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/PB38C4SYF01T) tracked by Bloomberg. Yet he said that the growing alarm around equities, particularly tech stocks, is unwarranted.

At the end of last month, Morgan Stanley’s [Mike Wilson](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-30/correction-worse-than-february-is-building-morgan-stanley-says) predicted that declines in stocks such as Facebook was a precursor to a correction that would be more painful that the February rout. At the same time, strategists at Bank of America and Credit Suisse sent separate [warnings](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-30/credit-suisse-joins-bofa-in-warning-of-tech-stock-crowding-risk) about the crowding risk in tech stocks, particularly the FAANG bloc of Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet.

“Our analysis leads to a different conclusion,” Kostin wrote. “Tech is less of a ‘crowded trade” than many investors believe,” he said, adding the firm’s weekly data on hedge fund clients showed 26 percent net exposure to tech stocks. That compared with 25 percent for the broad industry positioning at the end of the first quarter, which declined from levels in 2016 and 2017.

Moreover, there is still untapped buying power left from tech companies themselves. While the sector has announced 40 percent more repurchases this year, their actual buybacks are up at only half the pace.

“By extension, significant potential demand remains for tech shares as firms look to complete their existing programs,” the strategists wrote.","Forget Apple, Goldman Says, Flagging New $1 Trillion for S&amp;P 500",StockMarket,1

" In the last 50 years (1968-2017), the S&amp;P 500 has been up +20.2% per year (total return) under a Democratic President and a Republican-led Congress, 4 ½ times the +4.5% annual return achieved under a Republican President and a Congress controlled by the Democrats.  The stock index gained +12.6% per year when the White House and Congress were controlled by the same political party.  When the House and the Senate were controlled by different parties (regardless of which party is in the White House), the S&amp;P 500 has been up +9.2% per year.  The S&amp;P 500 consists of 500 stocks chosen for market size, liquidity and industry group representation.  It is a market value weighted index with each stock's weight in the index proportionate to its market value (source: [https://www.rixtrema.com/blog/15-weekly-stats-week-of-august-6-2018/](https://www.rixtrema.com/blog/15-weekly-stats-week-of-august-6-2018/))",STOCKS AND POLITICS,StockMarket,1

"## Key Points

* The S&amp;P 500 is approaching its all-time high, but indicators show weakening momentum.
* Investors are positioning their portfolios defensively as the stock market continues to climb.
* The Dow Jones Industrial Average is still 5% from its high. 

## The S&amp;P 500 is Losing Steam

The S&amp;P 500 is only about 1% away from reaching its all-time high. The index grew more than 4% in July with plenty of corporate earnings reports helping push up stocks. 

Looking at the charts though, we are seeing bearish divergences in the MACD and MFI indicators. These indicate weakening momentum, and we could see a reversal. However, it is important to note these indicators do not necessarily signal a bull market top, but it could point to a minor reversal where the index falls back towards its trend line. 

Volatility may increase during this time, but unless the index breaks the trend line support, this will likely be a regular bull market pullback. The index is currently 5.5% away from the trend line. 

## Sector Positioning

Next we look at sector performance. We use a Relative Rotation chart to look how investors are positioning their portfolios. By looking at the sector positioning, we can infer investor sentiment.  Currently, sector performance is indicating defensive positioning. Over the last few weeks the defensive sectors — utilities, health care, and staples – have been performing strongly. These sectors tend to outperform in volatility and market downturns, so investors move to these sectors when they are concerned with the future.  

## Dow Jones Industrial Average

The blue chips index is nearly 5% away from its all-time high. While the S&amp;P 500 has some help from technology, and the outperformance of the defensive sectors, industrial companies are having a hard time in the face of a trade war. 

While the index has been struggling, a good thing to see is that the price moved back above the long—term trend line, after a little dip below. Similar to the S&amp;P 500, the MACD is showing a negative divergence, but the Money Flow Indicator is not diverging. We remain bullish as long as the index stays above the trend line.

The industrial sector as a whole as been struggling. The XLI industrial sector ETF is more than 5.5% away from its high, and has been volatile. Since reaching its peak, the ETF has fallen by more than 5% five times. 

While it has generally recovered from each fall, this type of volatility could symbolize a top. However, a better explanation could be the trade rhetoric coming from the White House. New threats and increased aggression could be pushing the sector along this roller coaster ride.

"This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

"These are the latest Schedule 13D forms filed by activist investors in the last 7 days. Activist
investors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.
There is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.
Schedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management
(such as Index funds).

There is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize
is that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.
The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.
In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

"Seems like a pretty interesting play. Looks to be a very sound company in pole position on autonomous car components. Texas Instruments is in the same play. 

On Semiconductor is on track to make about $5-6 billion on the year and is only valued at around $9.5 billion currently. While comparison to Texas Instruments bringing in about $15 billion and valued at $110 billion. 

The P/E is near 10 while the EPS is at 2.14. The consensus target price is at about $26-30. 
My own consensus is near the top end especially weighing in on others in the same game. which would have the P/E be at 15 while TXN is at 28.3.

The CAN SLIM model for selecting stocks was developed by William J. O’Neil, founder and chairman of Investor’s Business Daily. The system is described in his best-selling book, “How to Make Money in Stocks: A Winning System in Good Times and Bad” – now in its fourth edition. The goal of the strategy is to identify companies with strong fundamentals and buy them as they emerge from periods of price consolidation, before they make major price advances.

The Elements of CAN SLIM

The seven letters in the CAN SLIM acronym stand for the key traits O’Neil found that stocks display just before they make their biggest price gains. CAN SLIM combines both quantitative and qualitative stock assessment into one easy to remember mnemonic device, it is described below.

C = Current Quarterly Earnings

Substantial earnings-per-share growth can attract the large institutional players – something that can fuel big price moves. According to CAN SLIM, investors should look for companies with a minimum quarterly EPS growth of 25% in the most recent quarter – though gains of 50% to 100% are even more attractive. Of course, you want those gains to be sustainable, so the company should also have at least 20% sales growth in the most recent quarter and a minimum 17% return on equity.

A = Annual Earnings Growth

While good quarterly earnings are important, a company should also boast strong annual earnings growth. This can help confirm that the company doesn’t have any underlying problems, such as falling demand for its products, deteriorating profit margins or negative industry trends. CAN SLIM investors look for an annual EPS growth rate of at least 25% to 50% in each of the previous three to five years. Remember there is no good reason to hold a company’s stock if its earnings are declining. STOCKS FOLLOW EARNINGS!

C + A = QUANTITATIVE
The first two parts of the CAN SLIM system – strong quarterly and annual earnings – are logical steps employing quantitative analysis. 

N = New Product or Service

The third trait that CAN SLIM investors look for is something new in the company – whether that’s a new product, service, CEO or high stock price, or an innovative industry trend that benefits the company in some way. Wall Street is always on the prowl for the next best thing, whether that’s an entrepreneurial company disrupting an industry or an established company that reinvents itself by pivoting to new products. Something new can equate to profits for years to come, and sometimes decades.

Domino’s Pizza (DPZ)
A perfect example of how newness can create success can be seen in Domino’s Pizza (DPZ). After gaining a reputation during the early 2000s as the worst pizza chain, Domino’s went through a major shift in late 2009. The company came out and blatantly acknowledged that its pizza was awful, and it was committed to upgrading the product. On top of rebranding, the company also looked to upgrade its mobile delivery system. With the implementation of these changes, Domino’s has seen its share price climb over 3300% since 2009. This is just one of many compelling examples of companies that – through doing or acquiring something new – achieved great things and rewarded their shareholders along the way.

S = Supply and Demand

The law of supply and demand governs all market activities: strong demand for a limited supply of available shares will drive price up, and an oversupply of shares coupled with weak demand will drive price down. CAN SLIM investors watch for sharp price increases backed by spikes in trading volume. These events indicate demand – especially from mutual fund managers and other institutional investors – that can lead to even bigger price moves.

L = Leader or Laggard

In any industry, there are companies that lead and provide big gains to shareholders, and companies that lag and deliver gains that are at best mediocre. The idea is to buy leaders and avoid laggards; CAN SLIM investors look at the relative price strength of a stock to differentiate between the two. A stock’s relative price strength ranges from one to 99; a rank of 75, for example, means the company has outperformed 75% of the stocks in its market group over a particular period of time. CAN SLIM investors look for stocks that have relative price strengths of at least 70 – though stocks in the 80 to 90 range are generally more likely to be the major gainers.

I = Institutional Sponsorship

This trait refers to whether the stock is owned by banks, mutual funds, pension funds and other institutional investors. Such ownership can be viewed as positive confirmation of a potential winner. Professional investors have teams of analysts who research thousands of potential investments. When one of them starts buying a stock you’re considering, it can increase demand for the stock – and potentially trigger rising share prices. CAN SLIM investors should focus on stocks that have at least three to 10 institutional owners.

M = Market Direction

The final trait in the CAN SLIM model is market direction. When picking stocks, it’s always important to recognize whether you are in a bull or bear market. CAN SLIM investors believe you should invest with the market, as opposed to against it. The theory here is that, according to CAN SLIM, three out of four stocks move in the same direction as the general market – as measured by the major indices (the NASDAQ Composite, the S&amp;P 500 and the DJIA). If you buy a stock when the market is in an uptrend, the theory goes, you have a 75% chance of being right; conversely, you have a 75% chance of being wrong if you buy when the market is in a downtrend.

",HOW TO MAKE MONEY IN STOCKS - ANIMATED,StockMarket,1
"I’ve always wanted to invest in the market but never wanted to take the leap. Finally about 2-3 months ago, I bought a small investment of $20 worth of shares in Helios &amp; Matheson (MoviePass) knowing it was a sinking ship but wanted to just get my feet wet with watching how it works, I was fine losing that money. That investment is now worth about about 7 cents lol.

Yesterday I decided to really go for it. and this is where I’d like to start getting some feedback on what I did right, wrong, could do next, should do next, etc. Yearerday, I bought a single share of a number of solid companies: Apple, Hormel Foods, TX instruments, John Deere, Cisco, Disney, Microsoft, Diageo, and Medtronic.

So I bought a single share of each, figuring they’ll all do well in the long term, are relatively safe, won’t make me rich but will likely all bounce back even if the market tumbles. 

Besides being patient with my current investment, was it smart to buy 1 single share of each? Should I have not have invested in these particular names? Is there something else I should look out for to protect myself and/or increase my potential of earning more money? Also, I’d like to continue investing a little bit each paycheck. I have the means to take some cash every other week and buy another share or so. Should I double up on existing shares, keep buying singles of even more time-tested companies? 

Sorry, I know it’s a million questions. Just hoping to get some honest feedback and guidance here.

A long-running bull market in stocks may be about to enter its final inning.

Morgan Stanley reiterated its cautious view on equities, arguing that a “rolling bear market” wasn’t yet over, and that it could soon impact the parts of the market that have been holding up successfully.

Specifically, the investment bank said that small-capitalization stocks — which have benefited from the uncertainty surrounding trade policy, given [**their high levels of domestic revenue exposure**](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-one-factor-has-determined-which-stocks-rise-or-fall-on-trade-war-fears-2018-06-21) — could be about to turn.

Michael Wilson, Morgan Stanley’s chief U.S. equity strategist, said he was “a bit leery about the fact that small caps have become a perceived safe haven in the event of trade conflicts,” and that this “perception may now be overpriced.”

Small-capitalization stocks, as benchmarked by the Russell 2000 index[**RUT,** **+0.77%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/rut?mod=MW_story_quote) , are up 8.9% over the course of 2018. The S&amp;P 500 [**SPX,** **+0.49%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/spx?mod=MW_story_quote) is up 5% this year, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average [**DJIA,** **-0.03%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/djia?mod=MW_story_quote) is up 1.9%.

&gt;*‘Just remember that those last innings can bring a lot of excitement and anguish, too, depending on which team you are rooting for.’*Michael Wilson, Morgan Stanley

The Nasdaq Composite Index [**COMP,** **+1.24%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/comp?mod=MW_story_quote) has been the best performer among the major indexes; it’s up 11.8% year to date. However, this is due [**almost entirely to outsize gains in a few huge companies**](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/stock-gains-in-2018-arent-just-a-tech-story-but-theyre-mostly-a-tech-story-2018-07-12), which have been enough to lift the index — and by extension, have helped to support the overall market. Specifically, Amazon.com Inc. [**AMZN,** **+2.07%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amzn?mod=MW_story_quote) has jumped more than 50% thus far this year, while Apple Inc. [**AAPL,** **+2.92%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/aapl?mod=MW_story_quote) is up 21%.

[**NFLX,** **+1.81%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/nflx?mod=MW_story_quote) disappointed in its latest quarter, and the stock has dropped 20% from its most recent peak, a drop that puts the video-streaming giant into bear-market territory, even as it remains up 76% for the year.

Facebook Inc. [**FB,** **+2.75%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/fb?mod=MW_story_quote) suffered its worst day ever in the wake of its results last month, and is now down 2.2% for the year, and it’s off more than 20% from its own all-time peak.

All five are in either the technology or the consumer-discretionary sectors, and, as Morgan Stanley’s Wilson noted, “within the U.S. market, we have noticed a significant divergence between the perceived weakest links and the stronger ones. From a sector standpoint, it’s really down to just technology and consumer discretionary \[maintaining strength\].”

“Our call was that these groups are likely to get hit next and, indeed, we think a meaningful correction in these asset categories began late last month. The bad news is that these sectors make up almost 40% of the S&amp;P 500 and close to half of the Nasdaq Composite Index, so the correction will leave a mark on the broader U.S. indexes if we’re right.”

He added, “if we are right and U.S. large-cap growth stocks and small-cap stocks finally take their turn in the rolling bear market, we would view it as the final inning of the game we expected this year. Just remember that those last innings can bring a lot of excitement and anguish, too, depending on which team you are rooting for.”

According to Wilson, Morgan Stanley recently sold 25% of its large-cap growth position, rotating that into large-cap value strategies. In addition, the investment bank reduced its small-cap equity holding positions by 30%, putting that into cash equivalents.",Bull market in stocks could be in ‘last innings’ as bears set sights on strongest sectors,StockMarket,1

"My understanding is that one of the factors mitigating fast and large slides and explosions in the general market and specific stocks has been the costs associated with performing transactions. Now that there are apps that charge no fees for transactions, like Robinhood, does this mean the overall investor base will have more of an incentive to pull its money out when a stock/the market starts sliding and more of an incentive to move its money around it sees a position (that it doesn’t already own) starting to go up?

I placed my questions up front. Some people are not into why a question is asked.

The market opened to triple digit losses, and will recover slowly in the next few hours. Any finance channel or web site has their opposing angle on why the drop and why the recovery.

What part of hype on multiples of real PE eventually works out to make the company show a profit regardless? I am asking if you know of a current tesla that is now profitable without debt.

Where can I see the divide, in real-time if available, between computers and manual trading by people?

Dark markets, trading of books for up to 24 hours? This sounds like lessor casinos and card rooms. Except that there be whales in the dark markets? What are your views on this market?

Is it possible that computer trading applies some sort of discount to a purchase, because there is no hands on transaction and communication?

Again, thank you for you time. I am really interested in this. It's a nice break for world news.

***Level setting my view of the world.***

I read news from outside the USA because it is a better view. I do read small town USA newspapers online.

Almost 80% of Americans say they live from paycheck to paycheck

While jobs are booming, they are whimpering in at contract workers with no job security or affordable family health benefits, and part-time workers within businesses that cannot afford full-time or benefits.

I do not see the same ""America is doing great"" as I do watching or listening to any market reports. Most people saying this are dressed in suits costing more than a weekly paycheck.

The typical American worker now earns around $44,500 a year, not much more than what the typical worker earned in 40 years ago (1978), adjusted for inflation. 

Although the US economy continues to grow, most of the gains have been going to a relatively few top executives of large companies and those that finance them into debt. Corporations will lay off workers instead of lowering top org pay and bonuses that are nowhere near any resemblance of the bulk of their employee's pay. Corporations are beholden to debt and stockholders. 

Think Toys r Us, debt payments from adding cash for stockholder dividend payments and mergers acquiring and breaking up smaller companies for their cash. Nothing to do with toys or the business of toys and they couldn't merger or borrow again to make the debt payment and pay dividends. 

With this dreary view of the world, I am confused about why anyone would buy into hype x times some multiples of basic business facts such as PE. It appears to me that so much money is in the market, that this is the only way to trade more cash?

These are my analogies for this thought: 

Apple, made in China, the same China that steals tech as a matter of culture. Tech is seen as opportunity for everyone. Tech for one is not understood. Apple is near a trillion in market cap. China can nationalize companies of they get pissed enough. 

Tesla operates in huge debt. Debt that would finance hundreds of other companies. The injury rate is higher than any other company in this industry. They keep it down with OSHA by not counting contract employees. Tesla seems t be run by a not so nice person, which nobody reflects to his business running deep in the red. He recently asked for payments returned to show a larger cash balance. Tesla is up today with all of this knowledge in the market.

Is this like Vegas? If you have a little cash, you go to one table, tons af cash, a higher limit table. Same game, same odds. On the books, the casino reports one game, money in money out. 

The little player (the middle class) can lose more and not recover, yet return over and over like insanity. The whale player (corporations) can also get into trouble, and be able to negotiate payment. Whales can get banned, black-booked to lessor casinos and hidden card games. Smaller players already go here.

Investing in the markets; If you have a little cash, you hands on trade from a pc or use a broker. If you have tons of cash, you invest in multiples using computers to keep the pile working and own a brokerage. If the little guy loses, he is wiped out and able to return over and over. If the bigger player loses, he jumps into IVX and uses the computers with discounts on volume to balance his trades in milliseconds of recovery. People here can eventually get banned to lower forms of making money or use dark markets.

"[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-01/fed-leaves-rate-unchanged-with-economy-growing-at-strong-rate](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-01/fed-leaves-rate-unchanged-with-economy-growing-at-strong-rate)

Federal Reserve officials left U.S. interest rates unchanged and stuck with a plan to gradually lift borrowing costs amid “strong” growth that backs bets for a move in September.

Economic activity has been “rising at a strong rate,” and unemployment “has stayed low,” the Federal Open Market Committee said Wednesday in a [statement](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/PCSNHOT1UM0X) released in Washington. “Household spending and business fixed investment have grown strongly.”

While leaving rates on hold as expected, the committee said it expects that “further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate” would be consistent with a strong labor market and keeping inflation near the FOMC’s 2 percent objective, repeating language from its June statement.

Stocks and bonds were little changed after the announcement, with the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 Index down about 0.1 percent and the 10-year Treasury yield at 3 percent at 3:16 p.m. New York time. Odds for a rate hike at the central bank’s Sept. 25-26 meeting held around 80 percent.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is trying to nurture the second longest U.S. expansion on record by slowly reducing the amount of support that monetary policy provides to growth. The economy is riding a tailwind from tax cuts and higher federal spending, though a trade war threatens to dent growth.

The committee described risks to the outlook as “roughly balanced,” and restated that “monetary policy remains accommodative” while leaving the target range for its benchmark policy rate at 1.75 percent to 2 percent.

“There’s a lot of concern that the trade negotiations and the heightened rhetoric surrounding trade negotiations might lead to slower economic activity later in the year,” said Mark Vitner, senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities LLC in Charlotte, North Carolina. “While it certainly looks like it’s all systems are go for another rate hike in September, and another one in December, the text hasn’t been written just yet on that.”

President Donald Trump lashed out at the Fed last month, saying he wasn’t “thrilled” it was raising rates. The comments threw a political cloud over the central bank’s decisions, though economists and investors had widely anticipated Wednesday’s decision to leave rates unchanged.

Most Fed officials in June projected three or four rate hikes for 2018, implying one or two more moves this year.

Policy makers weighed their action against a generally positive backdrop. The U.S. economy grew at a 4.1 percent pace in the second quarter, its fastest pace since 2014. Inflation is close to the Fed’s 2 percent goal, rising at 2.2 percent for the year ending June, while the core rate that excludes food and energy was up 1.9 percent.

The committee noted in the statement that both headline and core inflation “remain near 2 percent.”

Unemployment was 4 percent in June, below the Fed’s 4.5 percent estimate of the level that reflects full employment. The gradual pace of rate increases shows that officials want to see if tight labor markets can continue to draw more people into the workforce and produce higher wages, without sparking unwanted inflation.

Wednesday’s decision was unanimous 8-0. Voting members shifted chairs at this meeting, with John Williams voting for the first time as New York Fed president and FOMC vice chairman, with Kansas City Fed chief Esther George taking his place as an alternate for San Francisco while it seeks a new president.",Fed Leaves Key Rate Unchanged With Economy at ‘Strong Rate’,StockMarket,1

"This article was pulled from [www.robinhoodstrategy.com](https://www.robinhoodstrategy.com), I thought I'd share!  


One of the best pieces of stock market advice I ever received was from a man on his deathbed. This man was a former real-estate investor and at the time he was a patient of mine in the intensive care unit:

*Picking individual stocks is for fools!*

I was 22 years old at the time and although I had done a fine job investing for my age group, this man had spent his entire life investing. He found a very successful recipe for himself in which he shared with me.

He asked me if I had ever heard of John Bogle, to which I replied, “yes.”

I had heard of John Bogle. I knew that Bogle was the founder and former CEO of Vanguard Group, a massive investment management firm, but I never studied any of his works.

He told me to read “The Little Book of Common Sense Investing,” and that this book would change my perspective on the market. This was the first time I had been exposed to the “Boglehead” ideology – a term for individuals who stick true to the teachings of John Bogle. He said that many individuals believe they can beat the market by picking their own stocks, however for the average individual, investing in stocks is for fools.

## So if picking stocks is for fools, what should I invest in?

Let me introduce you to the index fund. An index fund is a group of stocks that you can buy as a bundle. By purchasing an index fund, you will own a whole group of stocks. This will protect yourself from some of the risk of picking the wrong stocks. In that index fund, some stocks will go up and some will go down. However, as Bogle has pointed out in his books, the stock market as a whole has always gone up over the long term. This means that if your portfolio (investments) reflects the broader stock market, your investment will grow over a long period of time even as some individual stocks go down.

## How Do You Invest in the Entire Stock Market?

You don’t need to be a millionaire to own the entire stock market. By buying index funds that reflect the S&amp;P 500 (which includes 500 of the largest companies on the stock exchanges), your investments (tax favored or taxable) will track the performance of the greater stock market!

This may sound too simplistic and perhaps a bit boring, but it’s not. Regardless of your investing knowledge or perceived skill level, it is extremely important to have at least a portion of your money in index funds. Why? PROTECTION.📷

Nobody likes to concede to the fact that their hard earned money will achieve solely a market average return, however many individuals lack the temperament and skill to consistently pick winning stocks.

Aside from the fact that stock picking can be difficult, there is also a time factor that comes into play when researching and managing your own money. Many individuals simply do not want to spend their weekends or time off actively researching holdings or potential holdings. This is yet another reason why index funds are important.

## But the Stock Market Doesn’t Always Go Up!

You’re right. There are good times (bull markets) and bad times (bear markets). The S&amp;P 500 index fund not only guarantees you the profits made by the stock market, but the losses, too. In fact, the market cycles through periods of growth and decline.

We are probably due for another bear market as the last one was during the 2008 recession. Don’t freak out and sell everything when it happens. We expect it to happen. Just remember that over a long period of time (say your investment lifetime) the stock market has always grown and things should pick up. Just stick to your investing plan and have confidence that good times are ahead.

You’ll never be able to time the market perfectly, so the best advice is to invest regularly regardless of whether you think we are at the peak or the nadir (all-time low).

## Where Should I Invest My Money?

Like I mentioned earlier, a portion (at least your first $10,000) should be invested into index funds, and should be contributed to bi-weekly or monthly (most workplaces offer this plan). Doing so will provide you a stable foundation for your investments and somewhat of a security blanket in case some of your higher risk investments don’t pan out as planned.

Where should you invest the remainder of your money? Well, this is highly dependent on your age, level of investing knowledge, and overall comfort level. There is no right or wrong asset class to invest in, whether it’s stocks, real estate, collectables and antiques, invest using your strengths.

I personally like researching and analyzing stocks, I find it highly enjoyable. A set portion of my portfolio is allocated into index funds, so I am well protected, however I am not a full blown Boglehead. I firmly believe in taking calculated risks and investing into high quality companies.",INVEST LIKE A BOGLEHEAD,StockMarket,1

"## The FAANG Trade Starts to Crack

### Key Points

* One of the most popular trades in the stock market is showing signs of weakness.
* Luckily, the damage should be contained within the weak stocks.
* Investors should keep an eye on the tech sector.

### What is FAANG?

Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google – the FAANG stocks. Many investors see these stocks as a proxy of the overall stock market. Prior to the recent earnings, these companies were worth about $3.5 trillion. The S&amp;P 500 has a total market capitalization of $23 trillion, so  FAANG makes up an eighth of the index.

These stocks became famous in 2015/2016. During this time, the S&amp;P 500 and other major stock indices were volatile. However, while many stocks were falling, the FAANG stocks were supporting the markets. These stocks helped prevent further losses in the major indices.

Since, this group of stocks have become famous. The FAANG trade has been a great buy over the last several years, and since, the trade has become very crowded. “The five stocks together have been the most crowded trade for the past six months, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey of institutional investors in July.” ([Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/26/worlds-most-crowded-stocks-fang-burns-investors-in-q2-earnings.html))

Right now, only a couple companies are showing signs of weakness, mainly Facebook and Netflix. In this blog, we will analyze FAANG, and determine whether the stocks are still an important asset to the stock market and what they are saying about the economy.

## Apple

Apple (AAPL) is the largest company but it has not reported 2nd quarter earnings. We will start with them. 

AAPL has been in a channel since it gapped a resistance around $127. Since the breakout, the stock has moved from $127 to Friday’s close of $190.98, a rise of nearly 50%. 

The stock is currently sitting near the top of the channel. The important price zones are outside of the channel. When earnings are released, we will want to watch for the price to break below or above the channel. A buy signal would occur upon an upwards breakout. A sell signal would occur if the stock breaks below the channel support line. Because the sell signal is so far away, now may not be a great time to open a position.

With Apple currently sitting at a $938 billion market capitalization, it is really close to becoming the first trillion dollar company. A good earnings report could propel the stock to the history making valuation. 

## Amazon

Next in market capitalization is Amazon (AMZN). After a good earnings report, the stock moved slightly upwards. Other market forces likely played a role as the NASDAQ Composite fell more than 1.4% on Friday. 

The stock has been in an uptrend since it bottomed in 2001, after the dot com bubble popped. Over the last 17 years the stock has moved from $6 to $1,817.27 on Friday’s close. This long term uptrend has been impressive as the stock has gained 30,187% over these 17 years.

The stock has recently broke a minor resistance at $1,600, and it seems poised to continue climbing. Right now, the important levels to look out for are the $1,600 support, and the green dashed uptrend line. A break of either of these would be a sell signal. 

While the stock has performed very well, there is a risk that it is a bubble. The stock has an extremely high P/E ratio, greater the 225. The stock is priced rather high, and it is because so many investors believe this is the company of the future.  The problem is that there are going to be more economic hardships before it gets to that point, so pricing the stock so high may be a mistake. At this point, it may be best to wait for a large downturn in the stock, before buying it at these elevated levels. 

## Alphabet

The third largest company is Alphabet (Google, GOOGL). The company has become what investors imagine Amazon can become. It has changed the way every person interacts within society, and the world. It has shaped the internet into what it is today, and continues to be a driver of innovation and technology.

The stock has essentially been in an uptrend since its IPO, only taking a minor dip during the Financial Crisis. Compared to Amazon, the company is a much better value. The P/E ratio is 53, which is still high, but investors are still expecting future earnings growth. 

The stock has been in a minor channel for the last three years, and is currently sitting at the top of it. In addition, the MACD and RSI are also sitting at elevated levels, so the stock could be ready to sell off soon. 

However, the stock and company earnings still look bullish, so the stock is likely to remain within the channel. Given the current status of the stock, it may be best to wait until the stock falls back towards the bottom of the channel, before purchasing.

## Facebook

Facebook comes in fourth, in terms of market capitalization. After the company released earnings on Wednesday, the stock fell around 20% losing nearly $120 billion in market value. This was the largest drop of market cap. value in a single day, in U.S. stock market history.

After the giant drop, the stock may be sitting at a good place to buy. The 20% drop brought the stock down to its uptrend line, or the bottom of the channel. 

This is a great place to buy because the sell signal is close by. So, if you believe the company and stock can make a comeback, this is a great place to add the stock to your portfolio. Your stop should be placed just below the trend line. 

Before you buy though, you will want to be believe the stock can indeed make a comeback. Continual selling pressure could continue to scare other investors into selling their positions, so the stock could remain volatile. 

After seeing the results of Twitter, the social media space could be wavering, and these companies may not be as strong as investors once thought.

## Netflix

Lastly, we look at Netflix (NFLX). The stock was the first of the FAANGs to release earnings, and it was disappointing. Many investors feared that it could be a sign of a spillover, and the rest of the FAANG members could see weakness as well. 

The stock has fallen more than 11% since it released earnings on July 16th. The stock recently broke above an upward sloping resistance line, at the beginning of 2018. 

This line has now turned into a support. If the stock continues to fall, the support level could become important. Investors should look to open a position closer to that support line because the sell signal should be placed just below it. 

## What Happened to Facebook and Netflix?

Netflix and Facebook left investors disappointed after their earnings reports. In Netflix’s case, they aren’t gaining the amount of subscribers investors want to see. 

Netflix has a lot of costs associated with the company. Producing their own content and scaling the business across the world is extremely expensive, so investors wanted to see high subscriber growth to combat against those costs. 

Facebook on the other hand, lost revenue  from a lack of ad sales. It seems that the recent changes in European Union law, and the recent data scandal with Data Analytica have had large affects on the company. Also, both companies project weaker growth in the coming quarters.

## Is the Economy at Fault?

So are the issues of Netflix and Facebook tied to the economy? Facebook’s worries are likely to be contained within Facebook. While new laws and regulations are hurting the company right now, eventually the company is likely to comeback. 

With 2 billion users across the globe, companies are going to want to advertise on their platform. Once Facebook can bring the level of security it requires, and users begin to trust them again, advertisers will start to use the company again. If it were truly a sign of economic weakness, then Alphabet (Google) would have shown weak advertising earnings as well.

Netflix may be a little different. Investors were upset because they missed subscriber growth targets. This could be due to the economic slow downs across the globe, relative to the U.S. economy. International economies are weaker than many people thought in 2017, and that could be a reason subscriber growth weakened the last quarter.

## Is the Stock Market in Jeopardy?

First, only two out of five stocks are hurting. Plus, they are the smallest stocks, in terms of market capitalization. Neither stock is positioned badly, and it wouldn’t be a surprise if they started to move up again. 

Secondly, the market relies on these stocks a lot less now. Index breadth is high. More than 64% of the Nasdaq 100 is above their 50-day moving averages while the S&amp;P 500 is at 67% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is at 87%. The stock market is much more robust compared to the time when FAANG was a major support. 

Investors do need to pay attention to the crowded technology sector however. While the sector has been a great performer, we are starting to see not all companies can keep up with Wall Street expectations.

A crowded trade means that prices can move swiftly. It may not be a bad idea to loosen some exposure to the sector while some stocks are at all-time highs. 

## Conclusion

FAANG has become a household name to most investors because of their stellar performance over the last few years. But, the trade has become crowded as these stocks have become some of the highest holdings in institutional portfolios. 

Now, we are starting to see some cracks in the stock group as Facebook and Netflix missed earnings. The two smallest stocks of the group have had their stocks punished, causing an 11% drop in Netflix stock, and the single largest loss of market capitalization in U.S. stock market history, in Facebook.

Even though these stocks have struggled over the last few days, they are still bullishly positioned on the charts. In fact, at this point, all of the FAANG stocks still look poised to grow. However, this changes if the stocks cross any of the sell points previously mentioned.

The missed earnings reports are also likely to remain contained within the stocks themselves. Facebook had the data scandal to deal with, and Netflix is spending more and more money on content, and failing to gain as many subscribers as expected. If these companies hiccuped because of the economy, we would have likely seen it in Amazon and Alphabet (Google) shares as well. 

Lastly, the overall health of the stock market is not in jeopardy either. There are still plenty of stocks marching the indices higher. Plus, the two smallest FAANG companies are showing weakness. The net drag that they have on the indices is minimal relative to the other companies within FAANG. Right now, Facebook and Netflix are not likely to change the direction of the stock market.

"[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-30/correction-worse-than-february-is-building-morgan-stanley-says](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-30/correction-worse-than-february-is-building-morgan-stanley-says)

The market’s leaders have gone missing this earnings season. For Morgan Stanley, that’s a worrying sign that the stock rally may have exhausted itself.

Despite more than 85 percent of S&amp;P 500 members [beating analyst estimates](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/PCOPLLT0AFB6), the type of pro-cyclical companies you’d expect to surge amid banner earnings have been falling behind. Not even the biggest winners of the year are posting reliable gains, as earnings misses from the likes of Netflix Inc. and Facebook Inc. hamper the momentum trade.

As such, risks to the July stock rally are building, and with peaking growth rates and extended positioning, the three-day slide that started Thursday will only get worse, Morgan Stanley analysts said.

“The selling has just begun and this correction will be the biggest since the one we experienced in February,” Morgan Stanley equity strategists led by Mike Wilson wrote in a note Monday. “It could very well have a greater negative impact on the average portfolio if it’s centered on tech, consumer discretionary and small caps, as we expect.”

The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 1.4 percent on Monday, bringing its three-day slide to 3.8 percent. The measure sank almost 10 percent from a January high through Feb. 8.

Some below-the-surface moves are setting the market up for a bigger downturn. One of the more curious developments since the reporting season began has been lagging value stocks -- those priced cheaply to their assets. Typically, strong earnings reports spur investors to bid up underpriced stocks. However, a market-neutral version of value has tumbled for the past three weeks.

“Maybe this reflects a realization that while the results are great they may also represent a peak,” Sanford C. Bernstein analysts, led by Inigo Fraser Jenkins, wrote in a note Monday. “Analysts covering value stocks are already ‘maxed out’ in terms of their upgrading of earnings forecasts for such names; we struggle to see how they can get even more positive.”

Yet there are some signs that a new leadership could emerge. Value was able to recover some of its losses on Monday, gaining nearly 0.6 percent, the most among 10 factors tracked by Bloomberg. Over the past three days, value has beaten the strategy of chasing winners by 1.8 percentage points, the best outperformance in eight months.

Analysts like JPMorgan’s Marko Kolanovic point to signs of a value rally that would pick up the slack in momentum stocks.

“Some investors fear tech weakness could lead to a much more significant market correction,” Kolanovic wrote in a Monday note. “We point out here that value rallies are historically associated with ‘risk on’ trades.”

Value stocks in a Bloomberg index outperformed growth stocks by 0.7 percentage points Monday, also the most in eight months.

However, the concern goes beyond the day-to-day gains and losses among value stocks. Correlations between all investment factors are on the rise, according to Bernstein, increasing systematic risk for active investors. Linkages may only continue to tighten as the earnings season concludes, as investors pay more attention to global threats.

Not only have same-way factor moves [ailed quantitative funds](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-11/equity-quants-reel-from-worst-run-in-8-years-as-aqr-takes-hit) \-- which rely on the diversification benefit of multiple factors -- but rising correlations also make it difficult for fundamental managers to scrub out unwanted factor risk, according to Fraser Jenkins, who recommends reducing active risk.

“With growth becoming less synchronized, correlation on the rise and value no longer representing cyclicality, this is all evidence that we are heading towards a phase when growth will start to slow,” Fraser Jenkins wrote.","Correction Worse Than February Is Looming, Morgan Stanley Says",StockMarket,1
"I bought into FB at $190 and NFLX at $390, when it dipped a couple weeks back I picked up more NFLX and got my average share price down to $375. It’s been pretty rough watching these two tank over the last few days, I’m reading about how there’s only so many people on the planet and this is bound to happen, but I hate to sell now when I’m down a grand total. I’m comfortable just sitting on them and even considering buying more in the dip but I’m curious what others are thinking. Anyone else in this position?

"# Last week, I wrote an article about how I view the potential effects of an economic collapse on American society. Unfortunately, many of our readers took it as an opportunity to post their perspectives on Trump and the democrats.

Yes, I know the country is exceptionally divided. However, I brought this issue to light not because I see one party as being the savior for this country over the other. Rather, I brought this issue to light to show you that we are on a path of history repeating itself, as we have forgotten the lessons learned from the pain of the past.

We all have to recognize that the United States took a big step down that slippery slope of socialism with the passage of The New Deal. Since then, it does not matter which party has been in power, as we have extended those socialistic policies when the masses thought it was “needed.” Thus, each generation since The New Deal has seen expanding socialistic policies. While you can argue whether you approve or disapprove of this progression, to ignore that we are on this path is foolish.

Moreover, the reaction to the financial market shock experienced during the Great Recession has shown us that our government is willing to go further down the path of socialistic policies. So, I really do not have much doubt in my mind that this will be the go-to answer when we get into bigger trouble in the 2030’s no matter who is in power.

But, I digress. The main point of this update is a follow up on my last article to explain the potential that the market still has overhead before we top out in the coming years.

A very [long-term chart on the Dow](https://www.elliottwavetrader.net/scharts/Chart-on-the-Dow-2-Month-201807231857.html), which covers over 100 years, shows why we still think there is upside left in this market in the coming years. However, before we are going to set up for that final run in the early 2020’s, I still think we will see a 20-30% correction begin in 2019.

But, once that 20-30% correction completes, our expectation is that the DOW can reach at least 35,000 on the rally into the mid-2020’s, with a potential blow off top taking us as high as the 66,000 region. In fact, the 66,000 region is the ideal target on the larger degree structure.

While that is quite a large range, much will depend on how that rally takes shape after we complete the expected 20-30% correction. So, it is a bit premature to be able to hone in on the exact target region upon which to focus. But, as noted, our minimal expectation at this time is the 35,000 region, whereas the ideal target has been 66,000.

So, as you can see, based upon our analysis which has kept us on the correct side of this market for many years, we still believe that this bull market has further to run. However, we are expecting a sizeable correction to begin in 2019 before that last leg of this bull market which began at the 2009 lows takes hold. And, after this last leg into the mid-2020’s completes, then we will likely begin a 10-20 year bear market which can take the DOW back towards the 10,000 region.",How High Will The Market Rally Before The Economic Collapse Begins?,StockMarket,1

"So looks like FB and NFLX missed earnings, and there are serious concerns about growth. Fair enough. Each stock took the appropriate beating. But now the rest of tech is dragging. AMZN blew out earnings and are down since they reported. GOOGL same thing. Other monsters like CRM are down this past week. AAPL reports tomorrow, if they miss, I feel its gonna be a bloodbath. Doesn't make sense because NFLX or FB's grown problems have nothing to do with AMZN or GOOGL, but such is the market.

"This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

"These are the latest Schedule 13D forms filed by activist investors in the last 7 days. Activist
investors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.
There is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.
Schedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management
(such as Index funds).

There is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize
is that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.
The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.
In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

**[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/90ph27/what_stocks_are_you_looking_at_this_weekend/)** was our thread from last week, which got a lot of good participation from the community! Thank you to everyone who chimed in with a post last week. It's always great to hear what people are looking over on the weekends.

What this thread is about is very simple - for everyone to exchange thoughts and ideas on the stocks that they are eyeing on this weekend.

This thread isn't just geared for the shorter-term traders. Longer-term traders are very much welcome to share their stocks as well. In fact, even if you are not currently invested in the market, but have a keen interest to monitor companies, feel free to throw your 2c in here as well.

To make this thread more engaging for everyone, I think it would be helpful if people could also post a brief rationale as to why a particular stock has got their interest (is there an upcoming ER?, chart setup you like?, etc.).

Both T/A and F/A are very welcome!

"1. Intel Corp lost $91 billion one day in September 2000.

2. Exxon Mobil Corp lost $53 billion one October day in 2008.

3. Apple had a loss of $60 billion on January 24, 2013.


Whereas on Wednesday, Facebook ended the after-hours session down 20 percent at $173.50, a loss of $126 billion.

Intel - September 22nd, 2000, lost 22%.

ExxonMobil, I'm assuming they meant the drop on Oct. 15th, when the stock dropped 13.95%. However, the entire month of October in 2008 was a wild ride of volatility for ExxonMobil. There were six days that month where the closing price changed more than 10% from the previous close - four which were positive, two that were negative. Talk about gut wrenching volatility!

And Apple only fell 12.35% on January 24th.

So, based on those three numbers, the drop in Facebook (assuming after hours trading holds) is on par with Intel, but the other numbers are far less impressive on a relative basis.

"So, Friday morning i was browsing around and came across a rather unknown stock called AWX.

Since Monday, the stock was on basically a diagonal uptick going into Friday. It had risen from like $3.50 to $6.50 with consistent momentum for four days straight. So it caught my attention.

Friday morning it shot through the roof, then midday, when everything dropped at the same time, AWX went back to $6 where it was when the day started—so I bought 123 shares hoping it would go back up to $7 by end of day.

Little did I know it would shoot all the way to $10 before the markets finally closed. After hours trading was fucking crazy, it shot from $10 all the way to $14 within an hour. From 5-6 o’clock it went from $14 to $18-19

My question is this:  AWX is about to be halted right?

And if they are halted, will it be halted at the opening bell? I want to know if I will have time to sell this shit off before it’s halted. I did not want it to go this high lol. After $14 I was getting pissed because now I feel like that money is going to be locked as soon as Monday opens...

"Obviously, the most talked about news of the week was Facebook’s huge earnings disappointment, which lead to a nearly 19% drop in value for the company’s shares yesterday. With that being said, I’ve seen a lot of people now talking about getting into $FB because it’s now at some sort of discounted price while still being the same solid company. 

I’ve often wondered the same thing in similar positions, whether to get into a good company that had a disappointing earnings report and is now trading at a discount to the previous price. But what I’ve often found, and what I believe to be the case here, is that we should shift our attention to another company in the same sector. After all, in the interconnected world we live in, macroeconomic forces have a huge impact on our investments. 

What I mean is, if you were a buyer of $FB before this earnings release, than you know that the core business you are buying is Facebook’s online advertising services. So instead of getting into $FB at a discount, why not get into a company that has produced a higher quality advertising business! This is not a revolutionary call, but my suggestion right now is to get into $GOOGL. 

As Warren Buffett has said (you see me quoting him a lot here because we should all be investors, not traders), “it is better to get a great company at a fair price than a fair company at a great price”. Facebook is a quality company now being offered at a discount. But if we are investing, than it seems prudent to turn our attention to the far better business at this time.

Alphabet offers EIGHT - count em, eight - platforms that have over a billion users, meaning advertisers have far more diversity of services to choose from to advertise their products. Facebook just has one, or maybe one and a half if you count Instagram. Facebook has warned that profit margins are going to continue to decline through 2020, while Google has shown remarkable stability in getting revenues to outpace costs. Google posted nearly 24% yoy growth in the advertising business in Q2, and, the hardware and cloud services business that is being counted on to drive Google into the future, saw a robust 36.5% yoy improvement. In addition, traffic acquisition costs for Google were down just slightly as a percentage of advertising revenue, even though total costs did rise. 

This may be an opportunity to get into $FB, but I think the real upside play here is in $GOOGL. 

Stack that paper friends.

"I. Remain Long-Term Oriented
A. Envision your retirement and the time-frame required to get there
B. Be patient
C. Practice mastery over self through discipline

II. Save a portion of earnings
A. Establish automatic deposits into an investment account
B. Stash windfalls of cash (inheritance, bonus, tax refund)
C. Curb your consumerism

III. Invest in Assets
A. Research and discover great businesses
B. Diversify your assets to reduce risk
C. Invest in yourself

Pillar One: Remain Long-Term Oriented

“Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it … he who doesn’t … pays it.” – Albert Einstein

The first pillar is the most difficult to master and thus the most important. Without a long term orientation the other pillars will falter. For example, if you are 30 years old and plan on retiring at 65, you have 35 years to go. Do not waste your precious time on daily news articles or claims that the “sky is falling.” We have a bias to think that “recent” news is “more valuable” information when in fact this is not the case. Media outlets and brokerages love to generate a buzz because it is good for their business; investors will check-in more frequently and trade more often, two things that hurt your performance. If you allow your long-term bubble to burst, your short-term mindset will take over and produce a plethora of mistakes.

In 35 years you should expect four market crashes. Use each as an opportunity to be more frugal and buy more stocks at a discount. If you are unsure about an individual stock holding during a market collapse, switch your holding with a market index fund during this time. This is based on the premise that individual stocks don’t always recover but markets do. 

The biggest enemy of the average investor is quite often the person in the mirror! Surprisingly, investors don’t lack good ideas and insights, often times we lack the guts to see them through to fruition! We must get out of our own way and allow the power of compounding interest to work its magic. This is easier said than done, however, the investor who will produce the greatest return has a long-term oriented mindset with mastery over self. There is plenty of evidence that shows that increasing your time period of holding a stock is the best way to boost your return. Put simply: more time = more money.

In Warren Buffett’s 1965 partnership letter, he gave us a glimpse on how to think about capital allocation:

*“The question always is, “How much do I put in number one (ranked by expectation of relative performance) and how much do I put in number eight?” This depends to a great degree on the wideness of the spread between the* ***mathematical expectation*** *of number one versus number eight.

"After more than a years worth of controversies, Facebook is no longer invincible.

Shares in the social network fell as much as 24 percent in after-hours trading Wednesday after sales growth didn’t meet expectations - and the social media giant said it would slow down even further in the months ahead. The numbers suggest that the political and social backlash against Facebook, and its costly response to it, is starting to affect the business.

Revenue totaled $13.23 billion, up 42 percent but shy of the $13.36 billion analysts expected. The company beat the bottom line forecast, with $5.1 billion in profit.

“We run the company for the long-term, not just for this quarter,” said Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s founder and CEO, referring to the losses on a call with investors. The stock slide Wednesday afternoon wiped out as much as $150 billion of Facebook’s value, and Zuckerberg himself lost billions of dollars.

"Hello! This is more of a macroeconomic question but It seems very strange.

For Background I'm by no means a Professional Trader I'm a Finance Student in Zurich. And I've worked in UBS. I'm trading as an individual Investor for 2 years with around $15k in capital currently.

Before the last recession in 2007 the US Interest rates were around 5% and Eurozone at 3.25% (very high levels for our times).

Now approaching 10 years since the last recession the US interest rates are climbing and it looks like recession is on the way (with the flattening yield curve).

However Eurozone interest rates are at historic lows at -0.40% with no hike in sight.

With that in mind, It looks like US is due for a recession with high interest rates and 105% Debt to GDP. While the Eurozone seems nowhere near it with Dept to GDP at 85% and interest rates at historic lows.

Question is how to play off the situation? Equities seem dangerous everywhere. EU bonds are hardly worth it.

To me it seems like the only possible plays are Short ETF's or Long Term US Bond ETF's (Sadly I can't invest in them because of the EU regulation...)

That leaves the only possibility to make some profits from FOREX. Im currently holding a 10k Euro short position (because the difference in central bank policy). But I think that in an event of a Recession the dollar will fall and I should be Long EUR/USD or CHF/USD.

Those are my thoughts. Please leave out yours so I could see someone else's point of view. Any advice would be much appreciated.",Eurozone vs US in an event of a recession. Possible plays?,StockMarket,1

"[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-23/tesla-asks-suppliers-for-refunds-to-help-turn-a-profit-wsj-says](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-23/tesla-asks-suppliers-for-refunds-to-help-turn-a-profit-wsj-says)

[Tesla Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/TSLA:US) asked some suppliers to return a portion of its payments to them in an attempt by the electric-car maker to turn a profit, the Wall Street Journal [reported](https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-asks-suppliers-for-cash-back-to-help-turn-a-profit-1532301091), citing a memo sent to a supplier last week.

The company’s shares dropped as much as 5.9 percent on Monday following the report. The bonds also declined.

Tesla, whose [eroding](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-tesla-burns-cash/) cash position has alarmed investors, requested a “meaningful” amount of payments made since 2016 to be returned, according to the letter. The note stated all suppliers had been asked to help the Californian company become profitable.

The request indicates more struggles for Tesla in its quest to reverse losses. While Chief Executive Officer [Elon Musk](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/id/1954518) proclaimed a “real” carmaker after hitting a weekly goal of producing more than 5,000 mass-market Model 3s, there are doubts the volumes can be sustained. Some of the increased output, pivotal for boosting revenue and earnings, came from a makeshift tent.

Tesla’s stock was down 5.7 percent to $295.64 as of 9:39 a.m. in New York. Its 5.3 percent bonds due 2025 fell as much as 1.75 cents, the biggest drop since May, according to Trace bond price data. They were last quoted at 89.375 cents on the dollar as of 9:31 a.m.

The U.S. auto manufacturer declined to comment on the specific memo, but confirmed it’s seeking price reductions from [suppliers](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/TSLA:US) for projects, some of which go back to 2016, according to the report. Tesla called such requests a standard part of procurement negotiations to improve its competitive advantage, especially as it increases Model 3 production, the Journal said.

### Money Back

It’s not clear how many suppliers were asked to hand back money, with some saying they weren’t aware of the request, the newspaper said. Panasonic Corp, Magna International Inc, Continental AG and Robert Bosch GmbH are among Tesla’s suppliers, according to [data ](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/TSLA:US)compiled by Bloomberg.

It’s not so unusual for carmakers to ask suppliers for discounts retroactively, and some Japanese automakers have done it before, said Tatsuo Yoshida, an analyst at Sawakami Asset Management Inc. in Tokyo, who worked at Nissan Motor Co. between 1983 and 1999.

Tesla probably has some leverage to gain suppliers’ support, given that the type of parts it uses is probably a bit different from other automakers and it may even be the only customer in some cases, said Koji Endo, an auto analyst at SBI Securities Co. in Tokyo. “If Tesla goes bankrupt, those suppliers lose everything.”

Tesla’s Australia and Asia media office, as well as a spokesman and spokeswoman in the U.S., didn’t reply to emails seeking comment on the Journal report.

“Only costs that actually apply to Q3 &amp; beyond will be counted,” Musk said in a [tweet](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1021285179178881025) late Sunday. “It would not be correct to apply historical cost savings to current quarter.”

"Hi everyone! So I’ve been playing around with $IQ stock lately. ATM I don’t have any shares, but what I’ve just begun doing is selling an in the money put for a good chunk of change that will likely be acted on. Once it’s been acted on and I get my 100 shares, I’ll then sell an in the money call that will also likely be acted on. Essentially, i’m not really holding any stock, I’m just buying and reselling with about an extra $100 thrown my way per week with the option values. Could I be doing better? I have about $7000 to trade with, so I’ve been doing this with $IQ and I’m thinking about beginning a similar strategy with $HUYA. Any advice is welcome, I’m just a novice!

Note: I am overall quite bullish on both of these stocks. 

Edit: I know all too well that this is throttling my potential gains. My very first call i sold was a 25$ call on IQ, which skyrocketed to $42 by the time my option expired (sigh).

- Hasbro topped Wall Street estimates for profit and revenue in the second quarter.

- The toymaker has emerged from the worst effects of last year's Toys 'R' Us bankruptcy.

- The company's revenue fell 7 percent to $904.5 million in the quarter, but was nearly half the drop that analysts were expecting.

The toy maker earned 48 cents per share for the second quarter, well above the consensus estimate of 29 cents. Revenue was also well above estimates. The performance came despite a drop in profit and revenue from a year ago due largely to the bankruptcy and liquidation of the Toys R Us chain.

Summary:  US equities have gained every month since April, and are up over 3% so far in July. Our long term view remains that SPX will make a new all-time high in the months ahead. That is now just 2.5% away.  


The short term is less clear. SPX has gained 3 weeks in a row; most often, these streaks are followed by a higher high without too much interim give back. Sentiment and volatility data mostly supports further gains.  


But, while July is typically a strong month, that strength has often been realized by the end of last week. The rest of the month is usually, at best, flat, and seasonality is typically a head wind in August and September. Right now, that tendency is further supported by weakening breadth momentum.  


Earning data pushes to the forefront this week: 35% of the companies in the S&amp;P will report their 2Q earnings in the next 5 days. The advanced estimate of 2Q GDP will be released Friday.

"This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

"These are the latest Schedule 13D forms filed by activist investors in the last 7 days. Activist
investors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.
There is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.
Schedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management
(such as Index funds).

There is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize
is that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.
The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.
In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

"OK, so I just thought we could resume doing these threads again in here every weekend. This thread idea was originally started by /u/sisumoney, so full credit goes out to him. :)

So, I'm not sure how many of us use the weekends to thoroughly go over stocks. But, I think the weekends are an excellent time to be an investor. You get waaaaay more time to go over companies without the market being open. Back when I was actively trading I used the weekends to really delve deep down into companies that were on my radar for the week ahead, going over the charts, financials, you name it.

It was really nice having the weekends to do all of this without the thought in the back of my mind that the market was open and I felt like I was missing out on something. I could really take all the time that I needed and not feel rushed.

I don't do much of this nowadays anymore as I'm not actively trading. But, for those of you who are either starting out or have been in the game for a long time should definitely be using the weekends to do the extra DD if you will.

Anyway, I just thought it'd be super cool to see what people are looking at on the weekends for the trading week ahead.

To make this thread meaningful, I think it would be helpful for people to post what they eyeing this weekend, and also include a brief rationale as to why a particular stock has got your interest (is there an upcoming ER due out?, chart setup you like?, etc.) so just kind of exchanging thoughts and ideas with the r/StockMarket community.

It does not matter if it's T/A or F/A, everything is welcome here!

So, w/o getting into further ado let's hear what stocks r/StockMarket has got on their radar this weekend for the upcoming trading week ahead.

Looking forward to hearing some good input in here this weekend.",What stocks are you looking at this weekend?,StockMarket,1

This chart shows that the five largest S&amp;P 500 stocks have a market capitalization equal to the bottom 282 S&amp;P 500 stocks. This turned out to be something of a Rorschach test, which was not my intention. I just thought it was a powerful visual. I wasn’t really trying to make a point, certainly not the point that many thought I was going for.

The reason I made that chart was because I was working on this post today, which will  attempt to show that there are plenty of other stocks outside of FAANG that are doing just fine. That tweet had the opposite effect. Hopefully this will remedy that.

The chart below shows the average returns of S&amp;P 500 stocks year-to-date broken down by market cap decile. The first decile is the 50 largest stocks, the second decile is the next 50 largest stocks, and so on. You can plainly see that while the mega caps are performing well, and powering the index higher, there are other stocks that are doing just fine. The 4th, 6th, and 7th deciles are performing better than the 2nd and 3rd.

It is pretty wild to think that the five largest stocks are as large as the bottom 282 S&amp;P 500 stocks, but the truth is, this is how a cap weighted index works. Yum! Brands can triple and it still would not move the needle of the index as much as if Apple gains 1%.

We are not in uncharted territory. The Pareto Principle is a feature of financial markets, not a bug.

"I’ve always been a big fan of Elon Musk. He seems like one of those once in a generation type people. His brilliance has been a large component in $TSLA’s more than doubling in share price over the last five years. 

But as I’ve begun to take a closer look at this company, it becomes more apparent that $TSLA is ripe for a short play. The shares have been down about 10.4% over the last six months, but the downside potential is much greater. 

When you really take a hard look at the earnings power of this business, the economic moat that it has against its competitors, and the current share price, it becomes clear that $TSLA is wildly overvalued. 

The Model 3, for starters, despite claims of robust demand from Musk, have seen 23% refund rate on original deposits (SeekingAlpha) and just 8% configuration rate in April, meaning nearly a quarter of original deposits put down on the car are asking for refunds while less than a tenth of original depositors are putting down the additional money to configure their orders. Combine this with the fact that Tesla is taking months to process refunds and it becomes clear that these orders aren’t turning into actual cars on the street. 

Now Tesla makes a sleek car, and they are certainly technological marvels, but the fact of the matter is that the economic moat that Warren Buffett often looks for in his investments is quickly shrinking here. This is because major car manufacturers both in the US and abroad are investing heavily into electric car technology and Toyota, Volkswagen, GM, and Ford are making a nearly $100 bn investment into EVs through 2030. Batteries are getting cheaper and electronics and motors are becoming more efficiently produced, but Tesla simply cannot ramp up its production capacity fast enough. Let’s also consider that the rare earth materials used in Tesla’s batteries (which, I’ll admit, are by far the most technologically advanced of the industry) are often originated in Africa (an extremely risky market) and, of course, China. Trade war anyone?

Tesla has lofty gross profit margin goals for the future but its hard to imagine the company reaching them, especially as the government begins to phase out its subsidies on buying EVs over the next few years. With all of that being said, investors still want to believe in the magic of Musk and have mostly sustained this $313 valuation. Fundamental analysis would show that these shares can’t be worth even close to that. Only ask the dozens of high level executives who have left the company over the last few years and cashed out their options on the ride up. You would be hard pressed to find a successful company that has seen so much turnover. 

I’m a seller of this business at the current price. I think Tesla is a cool ass company and have really sick cars. But real analysis would support a short. Stack that paper boys!!

---Content behind pay portal----

“Look at this,” Simpson said, motioning around the company’s headquarters, which take up a good chunk of a business park out on Northeast Airport Way. “We have 163 employees in Oregon. We support Oregon farms. We create jobs for Oregon. I’m a proud Oregonian. I take that personally.”

It’s a point of some sensitivity as more Oregon cannabis companies, looking for the capitalization needed to survive a sector overcrowded throughout the supply chain, https://www.bizjournals.com/portland/news/2018/07/16/canadian-company-spends-millions-acquiring-oregon.html turn to the Canadian public markets

Simpson was ahead of the curve there, https://www.bizjournals.com/portland/news/2017/03/23/a-big-pot-deal-golden-leaf-holdings-says-its.html striking a deal to sell his company Chalice Farms— with cultivation and processing facilities and four retail outlets — to Golden Leaf Holdings in March 2017.

The deal, though, brought more baggage than riches, Simpson said, and the year-plus since hasn’t been easy. There have been massive losses and http://thecse.com/en/listings/diversified-industries/golden-leaf-holdings-ltd"" the company’s stock is wallowing in the teens — in cents, not dollars.

But Simpson is confident that the company is now positioned to succeed, cleaned up and with the right strategy in place: vertically integrated operations in Oregon, California, Nevada and Canada, coupled with a novel plan to franchise Chalice Farms outlets everywhere pot is and becomes legal.

“We’re super-penalized and undervalued right now thanks to the old regime,” Simpson said. “It’s going to take multiple quarters to prove what our true value is. But in a year or two or three, it’s going to be a very different story.”

Put in charge

Though it wasn’t his plan, he said, within weeks of the Golden-Chalice deal closing, Simpson became the CEO. (One of the first things he did was announce that the company’s manufacturing, operations, sales, marketing and finance functions would be at the Chalice Farms headquarters in Portland. Sorry, Canada.) 

The reason the new board put him in charge, Simpson said: “It turned out that Golden needed to buy our company to stay afloat. They needed the new story, the Chalice pieces, to go out and raise funds.” 

Facing a cash crunch, Simpson, 38, took on that task, raising more than $33.5 million.

“Now we’re in a really good cash position,” he said.

Despite losing $56.1 million on revenue of $11.5 million in 2017, the company reported it had more than $20 million on hand as of the end of April.

“We’re in a really good position to do the things we want to do,” Simpson said.

One ambition is to continue to expand its sleek, Apple-store-like retail fleet, which now numbers seven.

Simpson thinks Oregon’s market is overpopulated with retailers, believing the current 500-plus shops will dwindle to 250 or so. But he wants a bigger share, and he’s not the only one.

“Chalice, along with Nectar and you can throw in La Mota there, feel like they can succeed where others aren’t as they develop supply chains and lower their cost structure,” said Beau Whitney, who worked for Golden Leaf before the Chalice deal and is now a senior economist at New Frontier Data, a cannabis industry analytics and consulting firm based in Washington, D.C.

Whitney believes superior supply-chain management, scale and branding will define who wins and loses, both locally and nationally.

“Supply-chain management is huge,” Simpson agreed. To make the point, he highlight the company’s new cannabis-infused fruit chews under the company's Golden label. They’re vegan and “wholesome,” Simpson said, and a 10-pack goes for $14 at retail.

The company is making about 9,000 a day in Portland, but has held off on pursuing new accounts because Simpson wants to be sure to be able to supply the current clients.

“If you go to market with something and people love it — and they love this product — and they want more, if you can’t fulfill behind it, that’s a big problem,” he said.

As part of a ramp-up, the company is about to open a big new CO2 extraction operation at its Portland headquarters, an investment of more than $2 million that will give Golden Leaf the ability to meet 20 percent of the demand for cannabis oil in Oregon, Simpson said.

“We’re perfecting the model here in a very competitive, consolidating market,” Simpson said. “That gives us a big advantage in California and Nevada.”

Ray Kroc-like

Meanwhile, there are the franchises. Or the idea of franchises, as none yet exist.

The concept was announced in March, and media around the nation found it irresistible. “Canada's Golden Leaf Wants to Carpet the U.S. With Pot Retail Stores,” Bloomberg said, adding that the company was aiming to become “the Starbucks or McDonald’s of weed.”

And that pretty much is the idea.

“We built a franchise offering just like any traditional franchise,” Simpson said. “It’s just that it’s Chalice Farms and it happens to be cannabis.”

The plan is a $50,000 fee for a franchise, and 5 percent of gross revenues.

“The amount of capital that I can raise isn’t going to grow the amount of stores that we want to see Chalice Farms grow,” Simpson said. “The natural evolution for us to expand our brand throughout the United States and internationally is a franchise.”

Other companies have expansion plans, but nobody has struck the franchise chord like Golden Leaf with Chalice Farms.

Brandon Rexroad, founder of Shango Premium Cannabis, said his company is pursuing a different model as it aims to expand. It has a trio of stores in Oregon and is looking forward to growing in California, Michigan, New Jersey and Florida, but is aiming to do so by owning stores, or doing licensing deals for the stores that the parent company, Rexroad Marquis Corp., doesn’t own.

“An issue is if you ever try to roll that up for an exit, there’s a lot more due diligence dealing with the franchises,” he said. “That becomes a big, complicating expense.”

But as Rexroad added, Golden Leaf has an advantage, already being public.

Still, Simpson said not to expect franchises to pop up into Subway-like ubiquity soon.

“We’ve gotten probably 100 inquiries, and we’re doing due diligence,” he said. “We’re going to play it close to the vest early, looking for pilot partners to really get the model in place.”

As for the first location for this not-Canadian company's franchises? They could be in Canada, where BlackShire Capital, which has signed a letter of intent with Golden Leaf to back the venture, is based.

So for example if I invested $100 at X100 leverage that means I’ve really invested $10,000. If the share price goes up 1% that means I’ve gained $100 right? But if it goes down 1% that means I lose my $100 but what happens if it goes lower than 1%.

"# KULR Technology to Serve as Technology Advisor to High-Performance Drone Racing Organization, DR1 Racing

**Space-designed, light-weight carbon fiber is coming to drone racing and, soon, commercial drones and electric vehicles**

July 19, 2018 10:31 AM Eastern Daylight Time

CAMPBELL, Calif.--([BUSINESS WIRE](https://www.businesswire.com/))--[KULR Technology Corp](http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kulrtechnology.com%2F&amp;esheet=51839858&amp;newsitemid=20180719005532&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=KULR+Technology+Corp&amp;index=1&amp;md5=a1b5f17e2beb6734811fde63e869624a), a subsidiary of KT High-Tech Marketing Inc. (OTC: KUTG), announced today that it will be the Technology Advisor for [DR1](http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dr1racing.tv%2F&amp;esheet=51839858&amp;newsitemid=20180719005532&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=DR1&amp;index=2&amp;md5=2dca01635581f74b3646c73f10eae2ed), the premier high-performance international and invitational drone racing circuit.

&gt;KULR to Serve as Technology Advisor to High-Performance Drone Racing Organization, DR1 Racing. KULR's space-designed, light-weight carbon fiber is coming to drone racing, commercial drones and electric vehicles. #drones #droneracing @DR1Racing  
[Tweet this](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180719005532/en/KULR-Technology-Serve-Technology-Advisor-High-Performance-Drone#)

As the league’s Technical Advisor, KULR will work with drone designers, engineers, and pilots to deploy the company’s space-used and NASA-developed carbon fiber technology – helping DR1 push technical boundaries in speed, weight, and safety.

“We’re excited by this partnership,” said KULR’s CEO Michael Mo. “The DR1 league is already skirting the very limits of drone and electric vehicle performance and, with our space-flight carbon fiber, together we can do some things that will really blow people away.”

KULR’s core technology is a vertically-aligned carbon fiber material that is lighter, more flexible and more efficient than traditional thermal management products. The fiber solutions replace legacy cooling options such as fans, metal plates and liquid pump systems – things that don’t work too well on racing drones. KULR’s cooling systems can be used to cool drone cameras, fast quadrotors and batteries. The combined uses of the KULR fiber in dissipating heat from sensitive components and reducing the risks associated with battery failure will help make DR1’s racing drones faster and safer.

“Together we’re going to make DR1 drones into remote-piloted lightning,” Mo said. “But it’s not just about racing and winning – there will be a ton of testing, learning and innovating along the way,” he said.

That’s a familiar pattern. Just as innovations in high-performance IndyCar racing spawned [many advances](http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcnews.com%2Fid%2F43074652%2Fns%2Fbusiness-autos%2Ft%2Ftop-indycar-technologies%2F%23.WyLbxadKjIU&amp;esheet=51839858&amp;newsitemid=20180719005532&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=many+advances&amp;index=3&amp;md5=dd91fd7ca6120e5f97bc6482c6074e34) in consumer automotive design and safety, technology solutions pioneered and tested through the KULR/DR1 partnership will eventually improve the safety and efficiency of many products such as electric cars, robotics, commercial drones, and millions of consumer electronics.

“It’s going to be a great, high-impact partnership,” DR1 Founder and CEO Brad Foxhoven said. “We want every crumb of power, speed, agility and ability from our racing drones and, with KULR Technology on board as our Technology Advisors, we’re absolutely going to get that – improving the sport, the fan experience and the technology in the process.”

DR1 has previously held races around the world and sealed television and sponsorship agreements with CBS, Fox Sports, DHL, Mountain Dew and others.

"I always love reading titles to articles that tell me I am about to read a bunch of ""reasons"" as to why a market is going to do something. So, I thought I would write my own.

When someone presents you with such an article, this is what they are really saying:

""The stock market is logically going to decide to move in a specific direction because the reasons for it to do so are stronger than the reasons for it to move in the opposite direction."" 

Ultimately, the underlying premise of these articles is that a market moves based upon logic and reasoning.

So, let me ask you some questions:

With what logician did the analyst consult in order to come up with their analysis?

And, when was the last time you read analysis from a logician in order to determine the direction for the stock market? I mean, would it not make the most sense for logicians to provide analysis for the stock market if one believes that we should be looking into reasoning for the market to move in a specific direction?

Yet, I am quite certain that none of you have ever read any logicians for market analysis. Why is that?

Let’s think about these questions. If you read and believe articles or analysis providing you reasons as to what the market will or wont do, are you really not believing that the market itself is a reasoning or logical environment? If so, then would not a logician be the most sought after analyst for any investor?

But, I am also certain that when I suggested it above, each of you likely just shook your head and thought I have completely lost it. Yet, while you shake your head at my questioning now, in practice, this is how you view the market.

Each time you believe in reasons as to why a market will move, it means you inherently believe that the market moves logically. But, anyone who has had any real experience with the market knows that this is a completely false premise. Yet, even though you may inherently know this premise is false, most of you still read and believe those articles about the multiple reasons as to what the market will do.

I am sorry to burst your bubble, but this is yet another exercise in futility. Believing you can reason with a market, which is clearly an emotional environment, is akin to trying to reason with your spouse when they are being emotional. How well does that work for you?

While everyone has been so concerned about how the escalated trade wars will affect the stock market, it does not seem as though the market has been listening to the news and the pundits, or even cares. Rather, the stock market has basically ignored all talk about trade wars having negative implications, and has continued to rally, as most market participants look upon it in disbelief.

Despite what you have been told to the contrary, the market really does not care about all the trade war discussion. And, even after this latest 200 million escalation, the market continued to rally, as it has now reached our short-term target in the 2800SPX region. At this point in time, I am expecting that we will likely see a pullback. But, the question is how deep that pullback will be.

Ultimately, the market does not really have to even break below 2700SPX to remain bullishly pointed to the 3000 region. Any break below 2700SPX in the coming weeks should be viewed as a gift, as the market seems destined to strike that 3000 region in the coming months.

So, if you are going to complete my article, and then move on to the latest published articles providing you with a host of reasons, consider this. We have had a multitude of reasons as to why the market would not reach the 3000 region we predicted many years ago - Brexit, Frexit, Grexit, rise in interest rates, cessation of QE, terrorist attacks, Crimea, Trump, Syrian missile attack, North Korea, record hurricane damage in Houston, Florida, and Puerto Rico, quantitative tightening, trade wars, etc. And, the market simply has not cared.

In fact, when the market was in the 1800SPX region in early 2016, I was pounding the table while pointing to 2600SPX+. And, when the market pulled back into the November time frame in 2016, I was again pounding the table and pointing to the 2600+ region no matter who won the election. And, throughout all of 2017, I was still pointing to 2600+.

You see, as I have tried to explain so many times, exogenous events do not drive the market in the manner that so many falsely believe they do. So, while you continue to read all those articles that provide you with “reasons” as to what the market will do or has done, I am here to tell you that you are simply wasting your time.

And, as I said last week, I am quite certain that someone will be posting a snide comment below about our analysis methodology and how ""squiggly lines cannot predict the market."" Well, considering how well we have been able to predict this market over the last number of years despite all the ""reasons"" you have read which were supposed to have crashed this market long ago, I would say that those “squiggly lines” certainly have the much better track record.",50 Reasons Why This Bull Market Has Longer To Run,StockMarket,1
"What to Look for Before Purchasing Stock Technicals

Support levels, micro(15,30,1hr,4hr) and macro(daily,weekly, monthly, yearly).

Resistance levels, micro and macro(same as above).

Trend(is it bullish, bearish or currently consolidating)? 

• Make sure to look at micro and macro scales


Mental stoploss (should be near the bottom support level on the trend that you are looking at).

Candlesticks (what are they telling you?)

Volume(is there alot of liquid in the stock?)

Float(how many shares are available to trade of that stock?)

Short intrest(how many shares are soldshort, is a shortsqueeze possible, why/why not?)

Moving averages(where is the stock in relation to these averages?)

RSI (is it overbought or oversold?)

Patterns (do you notice any bullish or bearish patterns?)

Fundamentals – can be found at finviz.com 
1.PricetoEarningsRatio(P/E)

• Use within same sector to compare companies, compare it to the average PE of the sector

• “What you pay for 1$ of company earnings”

• Want the PE BELOW sector average.

2. Price to Book Ratio(P/B) 

• If the PB is less or equal to 1 (1&gt;x), the stock is trading at/below the value of its assets.

• If the PB is greater than or equal to 1 (1&lt;x), the stock is trading at/above the value of its assets.

• Use this to compare companies within the same sector

• Current share value ($) / (equity/share)

3. Price to Earnings to Growth(PEG)

• Good to use on a company with rapid growth

• If PEG is less than or equal to 1 (1&gt;x), company is undervalued.

• If PEG is greater than or equal to 1 (1&lt;x), the company might be overvalued.

4. Return of Equity (ROE)

• “how well a company generates earnings”

• 17-20% = very good

• 20-25% = excellent

• 25%+ = superior

5. Debt to Equity Ratio

• Try to avoid companies that have a ratio greater than 2.

6. Current Ratio

• “the ability to pay short term and long term debt”

• x&gt;1 = liability &gt; assets

• x&lt;1 = liability &lt; assets

• x&gt;3 = holding back

7. SEC Filings

• File 4 = acquired/disposed of shares by insiders

• File 8/10K, looking for management optimistic/bullish

Financials

1. IncomeStatement (Revenues &amp; Expenses,P&amp;L)

• Revenue = driven by price and quantity of the product sold.

• Costs of goods sold = price of labor, materials, etc.

• General and Administrative Costs = price of sales people, utilities or rent).

• that takes you down to operating profit or EBIT

• from there you subtract out your interest expenses (amount of interest you pay for debt) and your taxes (companies have an effective tax rate) to get to your 'Net Income'

• Financial institutions like to look at a metric called EBITDA (Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation &amp; Amortization) which is a semi proxy for free cash flow

• its essentially your operating earnings adding back Depreciation and Amortization which are non cash expenses

• Depreciation (think of buildings, you have a building worth $100 and you depreciate it over 5 years so goes down by $20 every year but its not a true expense so you add it back

• Amortization is for intangibles think like Intellectual Property

2. BalanceSheet(Financial position at a given point in time)

• Balance Sheet (financial position at point in time). Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity

• That's the very definition

• On the Assets side, you have Cash and equivalents (could be short-term treasuries that you can convert to cash pretty quickly usually within a year), Accounts Receivable (what a client owes you in credit), Inventory, PP&amp;E (think like machinery for industrial companies). Liabilities is primarily A/P (what you owe ), Debt, both short and long term among others

• then Owner's equity is Common Stock, Retained Earnings (Net Income - Dividends paid to date) flows from Net Income on income statement

3. Cash Flow Statement(cash flow from operations, financing and operations)

• Cash Flow Statement, 3 main ones are Cash Flow from Operations (pretty straightforward what this means, day-to-day cash outflows/inflows)

• Cash Flow from Investing (CapEX is the big one here, represents purchase and sale of equipment, plant, properties, etc.) also outflows from acquisitions or inflows from sales show up here • Cash Flow from Financing is how the company raises money, you issue stock, you issue debt, and you get money

• companies can also repurchase their stock to lower number of shares outstanding, shows confidence in the stock

*  The economy is run by the government through their “5-Year Plans.”
* Chinese stocks may be signaling a slowdown in the economy, which could put the global economy in trouble.
* The Renminbi is weakening, which is likely a trade war tactic by the Chinese government. 

## An Introduction to the Chinese Economy

China is unique compared to the rest of the world’s top economies. It boasts the highest population, the second largest economy, and it is a command economy. Their economy is run by the government, and they have been in charge since 1949.

A command economy needs to be planned by the government. In a capitalist economy, market forces determine what products and ideas fail, and which succeed. In China, the direction of the economy is determined by the heads of the communist party, and they build what is called the 5-Year Plan.

### How China Became a Giant

Around 1980, Chinese manufacturing began to take off. They had a modern day industrial revolution which made China the manufacturing powerhouse it is today. 

There are many possible reasons why China has become the economic force it is today, so fast. Cheap labor, the rise of efficient shipping, and favorable trade deals have all attributed to the Chinese economic gorwth. Today, China’s is the worlds largest manufacturer, and exporter. 

Though the economy relies heavily on manufacturing, that is not the only place where growth is taking place. During this economic boom, China has slowly shifted from a poor rural population into an urban population. 

Through the years, China has accumulated lots of debt to build the infrastructure necessary for a modern economy. With manufacturing bringing people out of poverty, and the government spending on infrastructure, Chinese GDP grew at 10&amp;#37; a year for 3 decades. 

However, debt created growth is not sustainable, and China has directives in their latest 5-Year Plan to deleverage, and strengthen the economy for the future.

Today, China is in their 13th 5-Year Plan (2016-2020). “This 80-chapter, more than 60,000-character document seeks to address China’s ‘unbalanced, uncoordinated, and unsustainable growth’ and create a ‘moderately prosperous society in all respects’ through innovative, coordinated, green, open, and inclusive growth.” ([Source](https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/Research/The%2013th%20Five-Year%20Plan_Final_2.14.17_Updated%20%28002%29.pdf))

The communist party is committed to adjusting the economy to be sustainable and efficient. The first thing they are addressing is over-leveraging, and shadow banking. This is likely to hurt over the short-term, but in the long-run, it should help grow a stronger, more efficient economy. 

## China's Stock Market

There are two stock markets in China, The Shanghai Stock Exchange, and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange.

The troubles in Chinese stocks began in August of 2015. The prior year, stocks grew almost 180&amp;#37;. After such a quick rise, the index inevitably lost 50&amp;#37;. In 2016, the Shanghai index tried to make a recovery, and it rose about 37&amp;#37; over two years. The Shenzhen Index remained relatively flat. 

Now, the two indices have broken to bearish levels, and their is likely to be future stock weakness. This could be a signal of a weakening economy. 

Already, Chinese indicators are starting to show some sluggish growth, and some economists are predicting GDP growth under 6.5&amp;#37;. A slowdown in China could hurt the global economy.

## The Trade War

A slowdown in the Chinese economy could be coming at a bad time, considering the trade war with the U.S. As the world’s largest exporter, China relies heavily on exports to the U.S. A trade war with the U.S. is going to hurt their top industry in their top market. 

However, they are setting up their markets to help ease the pain of tariffs. Most notably, they are letting their currency plunge. 

A weak currency relative to the U.S. Dollar, or any currency, makes domestic goods more competitive. Also, businesses that export to China, lose revenue. This is because they sell the goods in the weak currency and exchange the revenue back to the strong currency. 

All things being equal, companies either lose revenue because they have to keep prices the same, so they get less when they exchange the revenue, or they lose revenue because they raise prices to maintain their margins, but end up selling less because of supply and demand. 

This gives them a negotiation tool, and a trade war tool. If Trump and China decide to continue the trade war, they can continue to let their currency depreciate. 

This makes them more competitive domestically, and it will likely hurt U.S. exporters. Otherwise, they can use the depreciation as part of a negotiation, where they can prop up the currency in exchange for less tariffs. 

## What U.S. Investors Should Watch

China is a global powerhouse, and without their strength during the Financial Crisis, the world economy could still be in shambles. Now that China is focusing on sustainable, long-term growth, their economy is likely to slowdown, and it could mean trouble for the global economy. Industrial commodities such as concrete, steel, and copper, could take a hit if China demands less. 

Investors also need to watch their emerging markets holdings. China makes up about 30&amp;#37; of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. As we have seen in the charts above, Chinese stocks are struggling this year, and they are a drag on emerging market holdings. If Chinese stocks keep falling, we may see emerging market funds struggle too.

Lastly, the most important thing to watch could be the trade war. China is a big market to U.S. companies, and the depreciating Renminbi, tariffs, and weakening economy can all play big roles in large cap stock balance sheets.  

## Conclusion

We should expect a slowdown, or at least weakness, in the Chinese economy. Their current 5-Year Plan is trying to clean up the economy as it deleverages debt, and focuses on sustainability and economic inclusion. Chinese stocks may be showing similar sentiment.

A trade war could exasperate the slowdown, but they are not going down without a fight. This could be seen by the lack of intervention in their currency. A weak currency will hurt U.S. exporters to China, and this can be used as a negotiation tool.

However, a slowdown in China, is not likely to be contained. It could spread to other economies, and ultimately, it could cause a global slow-down. U.S. investors need to pay attention to China and the trade war to fully understand the risks for companies that rely on Chinese consumers for growth.

My take away is that financial conditions in China are still very tight, with small and medium banks trading very poorly. Its also interesting to see the heavy machinery stocks trading poorly (although the trend is still up) given the amazing order numbers most are posting (excavator sales were up &gt;100&amp;#37; in 2017 and up &gt; 50&amp;#37; in 2018). Most importantly the ramp up in property stocks, especially the levered ones line Sunac and Evergrand seem to be coming down. I wonder if it has anything to do with HNA's founder death, which seemed to get very little coverage in western media.

For most westerners, the Chinese stock market is a mystery. For one, the Shanghai market has remained closed to foreigners for many years and only recently opened up via the HK connect. And its well known that the investor base in China is often overwhelmed with retail 'hot money' flows into momentum stocks and fads. That said, the Chinese stock market is still a big one and there are more and more institutional investors getting involved, so prices discovery is becoming more like western markets.

This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

"These are the latest Schedule 13D forms filed by activist investors in the last 7 days. Activist
investors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.
There is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.
Schedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management
(such as Index funds).

There is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize
is that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.
The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.
In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

"Hi all!

Newbie at investing here! I'm currently reading  to make money in stocks by william o'neil and in the chapter on EPS, he mentions 'be sure to check consensus earnings estimates (projections that combine the earnings estimates of a large group of analysts) for the next several quarters'.

"Hi all!

Newbie at investing/trading here, currently trying to gain as much knowledge on the subject through reading books and online sources. 

I was wondering if there is a scanner or charting software/website of some sort that is able to filter out companies based on a &amp;#37; change in quarterly EPS, or have its historical EPS data on some sort of graphical chart?

In the many publicly traded companies out there on the market, how do you guys cut through the clutter and know where to start looking in the first place? I've previously tried narrowing it down by filtering by ATR, trading volume and Mark &amp;#37; change on thinkorswim, and the resulting companies that appear (some of which include ABIL CBIO COOL tickers) have really weird looking charts that don't resemble chart patterns that I've been reading about in books. Or maybe I'm looking at them the wrong way. Either way, I'm currently reading how to make money in stocks by william o'neil, and am looking into a more fundamental approach, and hence the question on EPS. Any advise would be helpful!

I have no clue how to set up a screener for what I want ( $1-$25 stocks )

"[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-10/u-s-is-said-poised-to-publish-200-billion-china-tariff-list](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-10/u-s-is-said-poised-to-publish-200-billion-china-tariff-list)

President Donald Trump is preparing to release a list of an additional $200 billion in Chinese products to be hit with tariffs, according to two people familiar with the matter.

The list could be released as soon as Tuesday, and likely this week, according to the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the matter isn’t public. The publication of the list starts a weeks-long process that includes a public-comment period and hearings.

Stock futures fell and yields on 10-year Treasuries declined on concern of a widening trade war.

The Trump administration on July 6 imposed 25 percent duties on $34 billion in Chinese imports, the first time the president has implemented tariffs directly on Beijing after threatening to do so for months. China immediately retaliated with duties on the same value of U.S. goods, including soybeans and cars.

The U.S. is currently considering levying duties on a further $16 billion in Chinese goods, after a public hearing later this month. China has vowed to retaliate dollar-for-dollar to any further U.S. tariffs.

The new list would mark the latest escalation of the trade war between the world’s two biggest economies. Financial markets have so far shrugged off the first round of tariffs, which were long-telegraphed, with U.S. stocks up since Friday.

The press offices for the U.S. Trade Representative’s office and White House didn’t immediately comment when Bloomberg News contacted them.

### Broad Upswing

The International Monetary Fund has warned that a full-blown trade war could undermine the broadest global upswing in years.

Trump last month asked the U.S. Trade Representative’s office to identify $200 billion of Chinese goods that could be hit with 10 percent tariffs. Since then, the president has said his administration could impose duties on virtually all Chinese imports into the U.S.

Industry would be given time to comment on any new levies before they take effect.

Trump has been considering tariffs against China since his officials concluded in March that Beijing violates U.S. intellectual-property rights, such as by forcing American firms to hand over technology.",U.S. Poised to Publish $200 Billion China Tariff List,StockMarket,1

"I am 28 and started investing in the equity markets 4-5 years ago so I have only seen the bull run. However, I am trying to understand the pre and post dotcom era better and draw parallels with today's market. Trying to understand that period on the following lines -

2. Did companies with good business models make it through the crisis? I know a few big ones like Amazon, Google and co did, but what about a lot of others ?
3. I am sure there were dotcom companies that posted fairly good/market beating results even during the crash. Did the stock price of these companies tank too and did such companies survive in the long run ?

### Key Points

* Unemployment ticked up to 4&amp;#37;, but in a positive way for the economy and investors.
* Stocks are still bullish after breaking out in May.
* However, there is weakness in underlying trends.
* Are treasuries pointing to a market downturn?

Unemployment rose in June, but not because people are losing their jobs. In fact, the economy added 213K jobs last month. Unemployment ticked up because there is a larger pool of people entering the workforce.

This is good news for investors because it means there is more slack in the economy than previously thought. With more slack, the Federal Reserve is less likely to hike interest rates at a faster pace, relieving investor anxiety.

## The Dow Jones Industrial Average

The index is weak compared to other major averages. Trade disputes and tariffs are likely worrying investors of an impending slow down in economic and investment growth. 

The index has broken two major levels: the solid green trend line, and the 200-day moving average. Plus, breadth analysis shows that only half of the stocks in the index are above their 50-day moving average. Weak breadth and broken supports are signals that the index may continue to fall.

However, not all hope is lost. The green dashed line on the chart above may be a new support. This support could be the one that investors are paying attention to, and it also helps support our Dow Theory analysis. 

Dow Theory – the idea that the transportation average leads the industrial average – gives us a positive sign too. The transportation average has found support at its trend line, and if it holds, it could signal a recover in the industrial average. 

## Interest Rates May Signal A Top in Stocks

This is a chart comparing the 10-year treasury and the S&amp;P 500. The red vertical lines are points where yields peak, while the green ones are where yields bottomed. These lines show that treasury yields tend to lead the stock market.

Now, focus your attention on the solid red lines. These lines precede the market tops in 2000 and 2007. Each time, treasury yields reached a high near the trend line, and dropped. A few weeks later, a bear market formed in stocks.

Right now, interest rates are in a similar situation. They have peaked at the trend line, and everything points to them falling. If we see a dramatic shift in yields, we may see stocks fall next.

This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

"As the title says, i don’t understand why a company’s profits matter to its stock price. Obviously, a share is a % ownership of the company, so that would suggest that one should care if the company makes or loses money, but since shareholders (talking about the vast majority of shareholders who own a very minute portion of the company) see none of the profits not sustain any of the losses of the company, save for dividends, which aren’t guaranteed even if the company makes money. In my opinion, stocks are just commodities, and it is the populations belief that the profitability of the company matters is what makes it matter at all. Am i right? If I’m wrong what am i missing?",Why do company profits matter?,StockMarket,1
"Stupid question. Mainly a stock market one. I've dabbled in the stock market and such but this is the odd question. Back in 2002 my father bought shares in Disney for me and in a tech company. Not sure how much or any info on it I just was told don't sell it and I receive shareholders stuff in the mail every few months. He passed suddenly last May, step mom passed soon after him. We are clueless to where to even start. Since its Disney stock every Google search leads you in 10,000 different ways. Who do I go see for help or call? A CPA? Lawyer? Call Disney's front desk lol. Like I said I have no info on it just know my names on it. Where do I start?

 I would like to find out how much I own it could be 1 share or 1000's I dunno.

The stepmother side of the family kids and stuff fell of the face of the earth after the both passed so they're no help. They took everything or tossed everything and ran as this occurred across the country. So can't even get father's paperwork incase there's any info in that.",I have Disney Stock I just remembered about.,StockMarket,1
"Hello Reddit, I just turned 22 years old two weeks ago and made a promise to myself to start investing this year. I’ve always had an interest in investing and have been keeping up with the market for the past few years. I was planning on starting by investing with M1 Finance because of my ability to create a fractional share portfolio. My initial investment  is going to be $100 and will reoccur every other week. I was going to  start with a Tech portfolio since I’m familiar with the industry and believe in the future of some of these companies within it. Is there something better I should start with? If not what percentage should I allocate to each stock in the portfolio and any I should add. Clean energy companies would be awesome!
Thank you!

If I’m 19 years old and just started my Roth (maxed it out). Is it a good idea to put the rest of my money (about $5000) into index funds/ ETFs right now? I can’t afford to lose that money and I need to pay $6000 in rent next year for college. Do I stay in cash?

"Hello there,

I've gotten more and more into the stockmarket (Swedish, Balkan and the US market specifically) and I have a question about mining companies.

The company in question is Beowulf mining. Currently a stock is worth 0,62SEK (Which is equal to 0.071 USD or 0.060 euro for reference) 

Now Beowulf is currently mainly prospecting but they own the rights to a potential iron mine in Sweden (In Kallak.) Currently the project is on hold and is awaiting a decision from the Swedish government. The reason why it's on hold is because it's threatening the lifestock of the Sami people. However depending on how the Swedish election goes in September the decision could come relatively soon.

And from what I've read and heard the govornment is fairly positive (all though not much information from the representatives have come out yet)

If it would go through and they got the permit to open the mine are there any trends that seem to happen with other companies opening a mine? Beowulf themselves claim that it's a steady increase of the stock going forward but is there any good place where I can look up how other iron mines have grown from the opening of the mine to after say 3-5 years? 

Edit: I ended my last sentence a bit too early and forgot to add Euro after the 0.060. Fixed now",Upcoming mining companies what to expect?,StockMarket,1

"These are the latest Schedule 13D forms filed by activist investors in the last 7 days. Activist
investors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.
There is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.
Schedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management
(such as Index funds).

There is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize
is that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.
The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.
In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

## New Filings
This table lists new 13D filings in the last week. A new filing does not necessarily indicate a new position,
as investors frequently accumulate in advance before reaching the filing threshold.

"Hello everyone!

I am a German/American dual citizen, aged 20 and still a student. I've been living in Germany now for the past 8 years. 

I've come into a bit of money through my grandparents and want to start investing long-term.

However - evidently German Banks only open brokerage accounts for clients with *""US-relations""* in very special cases (due to a huge paperwork workload for the IRS, as I understand).

The only alternative for me is to start a brokerage account back in the states, as relinquishing my citizenship is not an option for me.

The truth is: I am **completely** overwhelmed by many things. I'm a musician with next to no stockmarket-related knowledge. Can anyone/other expats confronted with the same problems give me some general advice / a suggestion in what US-bank to open my brokerage account? I am looking at Interactive Brokers and or Schwab, but would appreciate input from more seasoned veterans. The money amount in question is less than 20k - or there any implications here?

I'm not looking to do a lot of buying and selling - mostly a safe option to keep my money. I will be staying in Germany long-term (due to family).

President Donald Trump is preparing to slap tariffs on Chinese goods early Friday, the first shot in a trade war between the world’s two biggest economies.

Tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese goods are scheduled to take effect at 12:01 a.m. in Washington, the U.S. Trade Representative confirmed in an email Thursday. The milestone marks a new and damaging phase in a conflict that has roiled markets and cast a shadow over the global growth outlook.

In Beijing, policy makers are digging in for what could be a protracted fight -- one in which they say they won’t be the aggressor. Beijing has said retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods ranging from soybeans to pork will go into effect immediately after the U.S. acts.

With further tit-for-tat levies already threatened between the U.S. and China, some investors are concerned this week may mark the start of a trade war that spreads globally. Trump has already imposed tariffs on imported steel, aluminum, solar panels and washing machines.

As the deadline approached with little sign of a last-minute deal, U.S. stocks pared gains. The Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 Index was up 0.3 percent at 11:15 a.m. in New York, after earlier rising as much as 0.6 percent.

The looming tariffs have prompted central bank officials to try to reassure investors. The European Union has taken a firm stance ahead of the escalation, with Bank of England Governor Mark Carney saying that the rise of protectionism will affect trade flows and push up import costs.

[Read more: what you need to know about the trade war](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-29/shots-fired-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-trade-war)

Here’s a run down of the key facts about China’s position in the conflict:

### What goods are to be targeted?

On June 15, Trump said the U.S. would begin charging additional duties of 25 percent on $50 billion worth of Chinese imports in response to what he says is theft of American intellectual property. That’s split into two rounds -- $34 billion on Friday and $16 billion later.

China has said it will fight back with “equal scale, equal intensity.”

### How will the tariffs be implemented?

Customs services for the U.S. and China will be responsible for collecting the new tariffs as imports pass through the port of entry. When products on the list for extra levies are declared to customs, the importer will pay the additional levies.

### Are markets ready?

Chinese stocks have taken a beating in recent weeks, entering a bear market, as concerns about the trade-war have mingled with worries about how an ongoing debt-control campaign will feed through into the outlook for economic growth.

People’s Bank of China Party Chief Guo Shuqing sought to calm markets, saying bond market risks are controllable and the economy is capable of bearing the impacts of trade frictions. The economic fundamentals mean a sharp depreciation of the yuan is unlikely, he said in an [interview](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/PBE4I36JIJVD) with the Financial News.

U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said on June 20 that officials are beginning to hear that companies are postponing investment and hiring due to uncertainty about what comes next. “Changes in trade policy could cause us to have to question the outlook,” he [said](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-20/u-s-trade-disputes-get-top-central-bankers-increasingly-worried) during a panel talk in Portugal.

U.S. stocks have wobbled on trade frictions, but the S&amp;P 500 Index remains roughly level from the start of the year.

### What can the real-world impact be?

The tariffs are already having an effect. As an example, Chinese companies are [reselling](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/PB1V766K50XS) U.S. soybeans, and Chinese companies are expected to [cancel](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-03/china-to-cancel-more-u-s-soy-shipments-as-extra-tariff-looms) most of the remaining soybeans they have committed to buy from the U.S. in the year ending Aug. 31, once the extra tariffs take effect.

Some American business are bracing for impact. U.S. manufacturers and business groups have said the tariffs could increase their costs and lead to higher prices for consumers.",Trump to Pull Tariff Trigger at Midnight in Trade-War Escalation,StockMarket,1

"Firstly, there are always leaders in the market. It’s usually good to have the fastest growing firms leading the market because if the value stocks with low growth are the leaders, it generally means the market is in ‘risk off’ mode and possibly going lower. Secondly, this is a misleading assumption because there are many stocks in the index which are down. You could add up all the stocks which have increased in the index and it will lead to much more than 122% of the gains. 

The way you can understand how this is misleading is that the equal weighted S&amp;P 500 was up 1.67% in the first half, while the normal market cap weighted index was up 2.52%. If only the top firms provided the gains, how come an equal weighted index, which isn’t bolstered as much by the big cap firms like Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, and Google, did nearly as well? It’s because the gains were broad based.

TRVN is a pharmaceutical company currently in the process of having one of their drugs reviewed by the FDA (November 2nd due date for FDA).  I believe the stock is undervalued and should have a valuation between $2.50 and $6.50.

"## Key Points

* The retail ETF XRT has made new highs after breaking out of a price range.
*  Consumers are benefiting from tax breaks and low unemployment, giving them extra cash to spend.
* The way the index is built has supported the sector, even though the “retail apocalypse” is upon us.
* However, the breakout is in jeopardy.

## Consumer Sentiment Near Expansion Highs

Investor sentiment around the retail sector has been low in recent years, as many investors feared that Amazon and other internet companies are hurting big names like JC Penny’s and Sears. While these two company stocks look dismal, to say the least, the retail sector, as told by XRT, has recently broken out to new highs.

In this blog we analyze the retail sector of the stock market/economy using technical and economic analysis. 

The XRT ETF has made new highs and broken out of a range that initially peaked in 2015. Is there a revival in the retail sector?

## Economic Boosts for Consumers

Retail revolves around the consumer. The tax cuts this year should help retail companies in two ways. First, they can help their balance sheet, as less costs will make these companies stronger. 

More importantly, it should also help increase discretionary spending by consumers, because they should have more cash in their wallets. 

Also, the lowering unemployment rate means there are more people able to consume. Rising employment tells us two things. One, employers are busy enough to need more employees, and two there is more money circulating in the economic system. Both are important to the retail sector.

These economic boosts have led to high consumer sentiment. The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment indicator is a monthly survey designed to measure how consumers are feeling about present and future economic conditions. 

When sentiment is high, consumers are more likely to spend discretionary money. Discretionary money is the extra cash consumers have after paying for their more necessary items. Tax cuts and jobs have increased the amount of discretionary within the economy, and it has pushed up overall sentiment. 

People are more likely to spend discretionary cash when sentiment is high because they feel that the economy is strong, and their jobs safe; they do not need to worry as much about the future. Therefore, they do not need/want to save as much, and they can spend some extra money on new shoes, a new dress, or that fancy watch they have had their eye on.

## A Broader Sector: Consumer Discretionary

Before looking directly at the retail sector, we look at the broader consumer discretionary sector. XLY – the Consumer Discretionary SPDR ETF – is one of three main sector ETFs to make new highs after January. The only other sectors are energy and technology. 

With the market struggling the way they are, consumer discretionary stocks are some of the bright spots. Like the retail sector, discretionary stocks have seen some benefits from the current economic environment, and they make them a prime target for investors.

## Breaking Down the ETF

While XRT holds stocks like JC Penny’s (JCP), which is down more than -33&amp;#37; year-to-date (YTD), there are some surprises from stocks like Macy’s (M), which is up more than 48&amp;#37;. YTD. 

Something that has helped the sector is high short interest in retail stocks. Investors have dubbed a “retail apocalypse.” The internet has not been kind to retailers and their stores. Now that consumers can find products with ease, and it is shipped directly to their homes, they no longer shop at actual brick and mortar stores.

This has led many investors to short sell retail stocks. So, when earnings surprises happen, and there is high short interest, short sellers buy back shares and quickly push prices higher. Surprises from stocks like Kohl’s and Macy’s have helped the ETF to breakout to new highs.

However, the ETF also holds a couple technology/retail stocks that have really supported the sector. Amazon (AMZN, +40&amp;#37; YTD) and Netflix (NFLX, +90&amp;#37; YTD) are two FAANG stocks contained within the index. These stocks have performed phenomenally over the last few years, but I have my doubts about their sustainability.

## Risks to the Sector

The biggest risk to the sector is a trade war. Many retail items are imported from other countries where labor is much cheaper. Tariffs and trade wars will ultimately hurt the sector as costs are raised on their items. This will hurt margins, and their balance sheets will weaken.

Additionally, tariffs and trade wars will also hurt consumers and consumer sentiment. When prices are rising, and jobs are moving overseas, or people are being laid off because of trade disputes, it will ultimately hurt the economy and the likelihood of extra spending at the store. Consumers won’t want to spend the extra money to buy something they don’t really need if they are concerned or uncertain about the future of the economy.

## Conclusion

Overall, this breakout is doubtful. The stocks contained within the ETF are all over the spectrum of returns. JCP is down more than 30&amp;#37;, but stocks like M and AMZN are up more than 40&amp;#37;. 

From an economic standpoint it is hard to see retail and the economy getting much better from here. We are in the later end of the expansion cycle, and the current trade rhetoric can have lasting damage on the economy, especially if we move into a full blown trade war.

Lastly, Nike (NKE) reported earnings on June 28, and the stock closed the next day up over 11.5&amp;#37;. Executives from this apparel company offered a great outlook and surprising Q4 numbers, propelling the Dow Jones Industrial Stock higher.

One reason the company has performed so well is because they are bypassing retail stores, and going direct to consumer. This is a trend that has been shifting the retail sector for many years, and one of the reasons for the so called apocalypse. More and more companies are launching their own retail channels and websites where they can deal directly to consumers, and skip the middle man. This is not a good trend for retailers.

## The Trade Setup

For the trade, you will want to look for the signs of a strong breakout in the ETF. You will want to look to enter the stock around $50.50, which is a 3&amp;#37; buffer above the resistance line. This will help determine that the breakout is real, and not just part of normal volatility. Your stop should be placed just below the resistance line. That way, you are prepared to sell if the breakout fails.

This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

These are the latest Schedule 13D forms filed by activist investors in the last 7 days. Activist
investors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.
There is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.
Schedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management
(such as Index funds).

There is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize
is that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.
The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.
In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

"So I got lucky with my first few option trades. I made about 150% off a call on IQ and then a 200% profit off a put position on IQ.

1) time
2) iv 
3) direction of stock

Was all going against me and I would rather take a loss then wait til it expires worthless.

So I decided to look into short selling and it just made more sense. If stock is declining then short selling can give you $$$ and you can buy to cover when you feel as though it’s going to go back up. And vice versus buy into it and ride it long or short term.

I love how puts and calls can give you so much profit but at the same time it’s hard to cash out on them as many things have to go your way.

I understand short selling a highly volatile 1-2$ stock can spell disaster but if it’s square...Twitter...insert big company name... you can just go in and go out and make some profit. If it runs sideways on you, you can close the position with minor loss. 10000 and it goes up 1-2% spells a 100-200 loss compared to losing 1000-2000$ premium on a put.

A hedge fund that reaped an outrageous gain in February’s vol-mageddon is eyeing a fresh target.  Houndstooth Capital Management LLC secured a 6,000 percent return from a bearish bet on an exchange-traded product tied to calm markets.  Now, the $7.5 million fund sees trouble in an ETF designed to profit from the opposite -- turbulence in stocks. It’s wagering technical forces in the volatility complex will help spur a swift return to stability in the wake of a blowout, undoing the leveraged product in its wake.   It goes like this: Even though Houndstooth expects another surge in price swings, it’s using out-of-the-money puts with near-term maturities to bet against the $413 million ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures ETF. UVXY, as it is known, is one of the most liquid, leveraged ETFs that profit from rising volatility. The theory is that after an initial spike there will be a snapback in vol that will decimate the product.  “We’re looking for areas where buying or selling volatility is mispriced by the market, or at least where we think there’s a very good risk-reward trade-off,” Lincoln Edwards, founder at Houndstooth, said in an interview. “There’s a risk that another massive VIX spike could destroy UVXY in a single day.”  Tucker Hewes, a spokesman for ProShares at Hewes Communications, declined to comment.  At $70,000 the trade is modest, but it highlights the contentious issue of whether securities such as UVXY can exert an outsize pull on the very contracts they track, exacerbating their own volatility in the process.  Hot Summer  Volatility investing has boomed in recent years as ETPs offered cheap and liquid ways for professional money managers and retail investors to punt on the burgeoning asset class. As Wall Street warns of a “hot” summer full of risk, and a more normal regime for volatility after two placid years, many traders are betting on bigger price swings in the latter half of the year.   And that’s how Houndstooth made its spectacular February return. The Austin, Texas-based firm bought put options on the ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF, or SVXY, thinking that an upward move in the Cboe Volatility Index would shake sellers out of their torpor. Sure enough, the gauge staged a record-one day spike, sending the ETF plummeting 83 percent -- and handing the fund its best-ever first quarter with a double-digit gain.  Houndstooth reckons it has a keen eye for technical risks in the underbelly of the volatility complex. Since the VIX isn’t tradable, many products hold futures contracts on the gauge. Given their size, some participants say they can exert a large pull on the price of the assets they track, underscored by the spectacular collapse of ETNs linked to calm markets in February.  Both long and short products buy and sell futures contracts on a daily basis to maintain their desired degree of exposure to implied equity volatility. That means a large one-way move in the VIX can dramatically increase the number of contracts they need to buy -- challenging liquidity and potentially driving the price of futures higher, according to Edwards.   Cboe Global Markets Inc. didn’t immediately respond to an email request seeking comment. It has recently outlined changes to the monthly auction for the VIX settlement.  Scenarios  For the Houndstooth strategy to pay off, VIX futures need to lose two-thirds of their value in a single day. That, in theory, would be enough to send the price of the 1.5-times leveraged UVXY to zero.  “Even if VIX futures gained 200 percent or even 10,000 percent in a single day, a one-day decline of 66 percent makes UVXY worth $0 regardless of how high it climbed,” Edwards said.  Of course, the grip ETFs assert on VIX futures likely diminished after February, as products either closed or shrank, while several ProShares ETFs reduced leverage, including UVXY, curbing their need to rebalance after sharp moves.  And the scenario didn’t play out after the VIX’s record spike on Feb. 5. The next day, the volatility gauge slumped by one-fifth -- only enough to send UVXY down by a third for the day.  Still, buying put options on the ETF rather than shorting it allows Houndstooth to limit potential losses on the trade, and there are a few scenarios that could lead to its success.  Under one, the VIX spikes from its current level to 40. The next day, as panic eases, the gauge knifes back down, its movements exacerbated by long buyers rushing to cover positions, and by volatility products flooding the futures market to rebalance holdings.  In another, the VIX could surge on bad-news speculation and then quickly reverse, producing a large enough intraday spike for the bet to pay off. Alternatively, the gauge could gradually climb higher -- only to deflate suddenly if favorable news emerges.  Edwards believes volatility is poised to move higher as November’s U.S. congressional elections approach.  “We’ll also see a third interest-rate hike, which will spark much more volatility than what we’re seeing now. Political uncertainty in Europe will continue causing major fits of volatility. Expect to see the VIX over 30 at least one more time this year,” he said.   The Houndstooth investor concedes that a 6,000 percent return on the strategy is a tail scenario -- but one “that’s massively underappreciated and underpriced.”","Hedge Fund That Made 6,000% on VIX Jump Bets on Next Blow-Up",StockMarket,1

Go back to my phone and the comment is still there as the very first comment.

Elon figured out a way to hide these comments and have them only show up on the mobile web browser version, not the iPhone App, not the normal web browser. He makes a bunch of fake accounts and keeps commenting on his posts from his official account. Dumb people fall for it and get their crypto stolen.

TL;DR: Elon figured out how to get unlimited funding for Tesla, $TSLA to the MOON! Also beware of crypto scams.

"I understand Disney stock value has been stagnant for a few years. I'm predicting a lot of change though. I'm betting they finish acquiring Fox, they get majority ownership of Hulu, and other popular IPs. 

Looking at the streaming potential alone: content is king. If Disney pulls off a streaming service and can offer all of their content on it (House of Mouse stuff, Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar, ESPN stuff) then they would have the streaming platform with the best content. They could stream new release movies direct to consumer. They could stream Monday Night Football (ESPN holds the right to this broadcast) straight to consumer, no cable required. 

Netflix has a higher market cap than Disney. Disney can do what Netflix is doing now, but better, in probably two years. Once the other major content providers develop their own streaming platforms what's going to be left on Netflix?

You're telling me the corpse of House of Cards and Stranger Things is going to be a bigger draw than what Disney can offer? No way. I love that Netflix produces their own content but theyre literally 70 years behind Disney on content library. 

Why is the market not reacting to Disneys potential? Do they not think Disney will acquire Hulu?

I realize the Disney acquisition of FOX is a lot more than Hulu and some IP, but that's literally all I'm focusing on and it should still be more than enough to send Disney's value way way up.

"CNBC: Amazon plans to acquire online pharmacy PillPack, the companies announced Thursday.
CNBC has reported on Amazon's push into the pharmacy industry. The deal will give Amazon an immediate platform into the business of selling drugs.
Shares of drugstore chains Walgreens Boots Alliance, CVS Health and Rite Aid all tanked on the news.
PillPack packages organize and deliver drugs. It sends consumers packages with the specific number of medications they're supposed to take at specific times. It boasts a ""full-service"" pharmacy, meaning its customer service team is available 24/7.

There are two things I see here. One, Amazon has a really long runway. If there is a product that can be delivered to you they will find a way. 

Two, is it time to either bail out of the pharmacy stocks and or short them? Will they become the next victim of Amazon?

"Back in April we posted our first article on the inverted interest rate curve and the correlations with the 2001 and 2008 recessions.  Based upon the rate of decent in the 10-YR to 2-YR spread, a rate-curve inversion was graphically predicted to likely occur in the year 2019.  Here is a more detailed progression of the lower and upper bounds for the predicted rate curve inversion date:

				Date of			Lower			Upper
				Prediction			Bound			Bound
				Change   			Date				Date		
				06/10/2015			N/A				03/20/2018
				Dec 2015			10/06/2034			03/20/2018
				Jan 2016			01/01/2025			03/20/2018
				Feb 2016			03/24/2020			03/20/2018
				Mar 2016			11/30/2019			03/20/2018
				Jun 2016			07/09/2019			03/20/2018
				07/08/2016		07/24/2018			03/20/2018
				Nov 2016			07/24/2018			01/09/2019
				Dec 2016			07/24/2018			08/29/2019
				01/26/2017		07/24/2018			01/03/2020

Earliest Predicted Inversion Date:	07/24/2018  (using 2014 to Current Lower Bound Macro-Trend)
Most Probable Inversion Date:	01/06/2019  (using 2017 to Current Recent Trend)
Latest Predicted Inversion Date:	01/03/2020  (using 2014 to Current Upper Bound Macro-Trend)

As you may note, the upper and lower bound dates contradicted each other until November of 2016.  Since July 8, 2016 the predicted lower bound (early) date has been stable at mid-2018. Since January 26, 2017 the predicted upper bound (late) date has been stable at early-2020. Based upon the recent 1.5-year trend, the Most Probable Inversion date is currently at early-2019.  Obviously, investors are likely more concerned about the early date for the rate conversion.  The good news is that the S&amp;P500 will likely peak some time after the rate curve inverts.  Using the 10-YR to 2-YR spread, this lag time ranged between 6 and 16 months for the 2001 and 2008 recessions, respectively.  Based upon our observations, this difference in lag time between the rate curve inversion and the market top appears to be related to the depth of the rate curve inversion.

DTRS will continue to follow the progression of the yield curve trends.

Conclusion:
With the Fed actively raising interest rates and continuing to flattening the rate curve, be watchful of the yield curve as we wrap-up 2018.  If the curve inverts, start planning your market exit point.

The White House opted to take a less confrontational approach toward Chinese investments in the U.S. as it pushes Congress to strengthen an existing review process rather than invoke a little-used law reserved for economic emergencies.

President [Donald Trump](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/id/1252249) wants Congress to pass legislation to bolster the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or CFIUS, so it can prevent companies from violating intellectual-property rights of American companies, two administration officials said Wednesday, speaking to reporters on the condition of anonymity.

The administration decided not to employ the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 that would give the president broad authority to curb Chinese investments in the country.

The decision comes amid White House allegations that China engages in widespread theft of intellectual property. The inter-agency CFIUS panel, if bolstered by Congress, can address those concerns while maintaining an open investment climate, one of the administration officials said.

Trump’s choice shows that he is favoring a more measured strategy that requires coordination with Congress, rather than working solely through the executive branch. It’s also a win for proponents of conciliatory tone in negotiations with China such as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who told reporters on Wednesday that moves to strengthen CFIUS aren’t intended to single out Beijing.

“This is not intended to target China,” Mnuchin said. “It’s fair to say that certain countries will get a heightened review; I don’t think we need a list of special countries.”

CFIUS legislation passed in the House would expand investigations by the panel to include minority investments in “critical technology” or “critical infrastructure” and joint ventures where technology companies contribute intellectual property. While CFIUS reviews are technically voluntary, the bill would require foreign investors that are at least 25 percent owned by foreign governments to go through CFIUS when they are acquiring at least a 25 percent stake in a U.S. business.

[Read more from QuickTake on CFIUS](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-23/all-about-cfius-trump-s-watchdog-on-china-dealmaking-quicktake)

The Treasury Department has been closely involved in drafting the legislation, and Congress secured the administration’s full support before proposing it.

Mnuchin on Wednesday increased pressure on Congress to approve the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act, or FIRRMA, saying lawmakers must act fast.

“Should Congress fail to pass strong FIRRMA legislation that better protects the crown jewels of American technology and intellectual property from transfers and acquisitions that threaten our national security -- and future economic prosperity -- I will direct my Administration to deploy new tools, developed under existing authorities, that will do so globally,” Trump said in a statement.

Only five takeovers of American firms have been blocked by U.S. presidents on national security grounds since 1990. Trump has used the tool more frequently than past administrations.

“This is a positive development. It avoids use of emergency powers, which would have created a new ad hoc and highly uncertain framework,” said Robert Kahn, a professor at American University who previously worked at the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. “The new congressional legislation strengthening CFIUS could still have a chilling effect on Chinese investment depending on how it is implemented.”",Trump Decides Against Harshest Measures on China Investments,StockMarket,1

Key Points
The financial sector is the only one not to breakout out of its recent pattern.
Interest rates face a strong downtrend.
Regional banks are performing well, but large diversified banks are having a negative year.
International stocks are also struggling in 2018.

What's Holding Back the Financial Sector?
Since the end of January, the markets have been volatile compared to 2017. Most sectors of the S&amp;P 500 moved into a pennant/flag formation, while investors tried to figure out what the future of the economy and stock market was. The S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average also fell into similar patterns.


In May, the major indices broke out of their patterns, and most of the sectors followed suit. However, the financial sector has struggled, and has failed to make a breakout. 

With a plethora of political noise, tariffs, and trade wars, it would be easy to believe that investors are on hold, waiting for a catalyst to either shoot stocks higher, or bring them down. But only the financial sector is struggling. Why?

In this blog, we will use technical analysis to determine why the sector is the only one, of the five sector in a pattern, not to breakout.

Interest Rates
First, we will look at interest rates. When the Fed started to normalize interest rates, many investors believed it would help banks and other financial stocks.

As interest rates rise, bank and financial company revenues tend to rise as well. This is because financial companies are tied to loans and credit, and these become more expensive when there are higher interest rates.

The End of a Long Bull?
The 10-year Treasury has failed to break above its long-term downtrend, which started in the 80’s. This is a strong trend, that has been in place for more than 30 years, and it could be a reason why investors are reluctant to bet on financial stocks going higher.

A trend that has lasted this long has some power to it. Investors have followed it, and have relied on it for diversification and income. If the trend breaks, it could reshape the way that investors and portfolio managers view bonds, and the diversification benefits they hold. 

How will investors feel if they are constantly losing money on their bonds because interest rates are constantly rising, rather than falling?

Subscribe to Our Blog!
A Breakout in Rates before a Breakout in Stocks?
Bringing it back to financial stocks, interest rates have not broken out, and it is possible that many had thought they would. It could be that investors are waiting to see interest rates continue to rise, before pushing financial stocks higher.

But this may not be the only story. The performance between large financial institutions and regional banks tells us that there may be other reasons why the financial sector is on hold.

Big Banks vs. Regional Banks
To compare banks versus regional banks, we look at KBE and KRE. KBE is the SPDR S&amp;P Banking ETF and KRE is the SPDR S&amp;P Regional Bank ETF.

KBE year-to-date return: 3.28%
KRE year-to-date return: 7.70%

While the ETFs have very similar holdings, KRE has performed much better this year, compared to KBE. KBE has 78% exposure to regional banks, compared to 100% in KRE, so the under performance must be coming from other areas such as diversified banks, thrift and mortgage finance, and asset management and custody banks.

Breaking Down the Banking ETFs
Diversified banks are the large institutions that cater to many large industries, both at home and abroad. Institutions like JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs are examples of these banks. 

Thrift and mortgage banks are institutions that cater mostly to consumers, rather than business. These banks are generally smaller, and benefit from a strong local economy. 

Lastly, asset management and custody banks are companies like Schwab or TD Ameritrade. They are brokerage firms, and custody investor funds and portfolios.

Diversified banks may be the culprit for the under performance of KBE. JP Morgan Chase (JPM) is one of the better performers with a YTD return of -1% but banks like Citi (C), Goldman Sachs (GS), and Morgan Stanley (MS) are having harder years.

Year-To-Date Returns
Morgan Stanley (MS) —  -5.4%
Citi (C) —  -8.8%
Goldman Sachs (GS) —  -11%

International Uncertainty Hurting Diversified Banks
Diversified banks are much larger than retail banks, and they also carry international exposure. XLF has had a strong correlation to EFA – iShares MSCI EAFE ETF, so the struggles with diversified banks could be with the international markets. 

International and Emerging Markets
International stocks are having a hard time this year. There is a lot of uncertainty pertaining to them. China, the European Union, Canada, and Mexico may all enter into a possible trade war with the U.S. In Europe, there is also the affects of Brexit, and other possible populist movements within the EU.

Emerging market stocks are also struggling this year, and over the last couple of years, XLF has had a positive correlation to EEM – iShares Emerging Markets ETF. 

However, International developed and emerging market stocks still look like they are in the infancy of a long-term breakout. In the short-term, uncertainty is holding these stocks back, and making them more volatile. Recovery issues, trade uncertainty, and international relations are all a problem.

International ETF Key Levels
While the charts look like the beginnings of a new uptrend, we still want to look for the key levels that would put that in jeopardy. For EEM, the key price level is $40, and for EFA, the key level is $62. If the ETFs fall below these levels, we would be forced to classify the moves as false breakouts, and the ETFs could be in jeopardy of further declines.

For now, we can still assume that EAFE and Emerging Market stocks are going to continue higher over the long-term, and hopefully this will bring diversified banks, and the financial sector up with them.

Conclusion
While diversified bank stocks like Citi and Goldman Sachs don’t look great, the financial sector as a whole is holding up. Regional banks are performing well, but the international exposure from diversified banks may be hurting the XLF ETF. 

Regional banks have received benefits from the tax cuts and higher interest rates. With the good performance, it could signal that investors are expecting interest rates to continue rising, and they will break the 30+ year downtrend. 

Since regional banks are performing well, it is more likely that the international exposure of diversified banks are hurting the financial sector as a whole. The uncertainty of international relations is certainly bogging down stock performance over seas, but that doesn’t mean international stocks are down and out.

Hopefully this is only a minor setback in the beginning of a new sustained uptrend in both international developed and emerging market stocks. When these stocks start to turn back up, hopefully they bring diversified banking stocks with them, and the financial sector grows as well.

"Buying low and selling high with an occasional loss or not much profit. I’ve done a lot of research on certain oil and gas companies, energy, pharmacy, weed stocks, and a prison real estate company. I did all of this to see if I had what it takes to successfully play in the market. 
 
These are the companies I bought low and sold high, that really helped me with my gains.
1.GEO
2.CHK

My small gains were 
1.SWN
2.KMPH
3.COG

My only loss was GE. I got out of it quickly after doing more research and now I’m glad I did.

CHK I feel was just luck. It was a free stock from robinhood, I was new and decided to buy $20 worth since it was cheap. I bought GEO when it was low. GEO, I feel, is more predictable because it rose and fell around the same time last year which is how I made my guess.  

I now have all my earnings sitting in CGC and CRON.(They both took a dip Friday and toady)

Since I’ve doubled my money, I’m thinking about going all in soon.  I honestly couldn’t afford to put $80 in last year but I took the chance. I’ve always wanted to learn the market and bought a couple books on how to get started. I have $2k in my savings and as soon as I get the courage and see a great buying opportunity, I’m going to dump nearly all of it into my RH account. 

If I lose I might be financially handicapped for awhile. If I win then I’ll have more than I started out with and might start trading options. If I break even, I’ll say that was fucking stupid and not worth the stress I put myself under of potentially losing my life savings.  I love paycheck to paycheck but I’m able to a little in savings. I have a good car, some job security, and cheap rent. I’ve taken everything into consideration and know what I have to lose.

Wish me luck!

"For those that follow me regularly, you will know that I have been tracking a set-up for the SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSEARCA:GLD), which I analyze as a proxy for the gold market. I also believe that gold can outperform the general equity market once we confirm a long-term break out has begun, and I still think we can see it in occur in 2018. This week, I will provide an update to GLD.

While I have gone on record as to why I do not think GLD ETF is a wise long-term investment hold, I still use it to track the market movements. For those that have not seen my webinar about why I don’t think the GLD is a wise long-term investment, feel free to review this link for my webinar on the matter. https://www.elliottwavetrader.net/videos/201411131445.html

For the last year and a half, the metals complex has frustrated everyone who has invested in the complex with a sideways consolidation. Many have been certain that it is setting us up to break below $1,000 gold, and the voices for that have been getting louder and more numerous.

As I noted to the members of ElliottWaveTrader:

“Calls for sub $1,000 gold are being heard quite loudly. Many are 'feeling' that the metals bear market has not ended. And, we have the usual suspects who have been terribly whipsawed in this market following trendline analysis highlighting the current trend line break down again. Isn’t this all too familiar to you already? 

""Each time this has happened over the last two years, the metals have staged a “surprising” rally to the upside. Yes, when the beachball gets pushed too far down, it is bound to rise to the surface, and often with strong force. And, with this market only going sideways for well over a year, there does not seem to be many left who are looking higher in this market. But, that is how major rallies begin – when most are looking lower or are completely disinterested. Major rallies often begin with the fewest passengers aboard the train.""

As I looked around the web on Friday, I felt quite lonely maintaining an expectation for an imminent bottom in the metals complex. While most of the market is totally disgusted with the lack of movement in the complex for the last year and a half, and whereas the great majority of the market seems quite bearish (other than the perma-bulls), it is hard to see how the market is going to accelerate lower from here. Rather, I think the signs are pointing to the market bottoming rather than heading to sub-$1000 gold, which many believe is imminent.

For the two weeks before the last downside was seen in the metals complex, I warned my members that we will likely test support in the complex, as the market had a short-term downside setup in place:

“At the end of the day, we still have immediate set ups, as noted above, which are pointing a bit lower in the complex . . . until the market takes out the noted resistance, we have to respect the micro set ups which are pointing a bit lower before the next rally takes hold.”

Currently, we have almost reached those support levels to which we were pointing weeks ago. For those that have read my metals analysis over the last few months, you would know that my perspective has been that, as long as GLD holds the 119 support region, we still have a very powerful rally setup in place. And, as long as GLD holds that 119 region as support, the market still retains a set up to rally strongly towards the 150 region in 2018. It would take a break down below 117.40 to invalidate that immediate setup, but a sustained break down below 119 would begin to get me concerned.

And, since we deal in probabilities and not certainties when analyzing financial markets, we have to maintain an objective perspective to understand if the market will follow through on the setups we see, or if they will invalidate those setups. Many took me to task for being too bearish in the metals complex until the end of 2015. But, once the structure pointed to a major low being near, I turned quite bullish, and even rolled out the EWT Miners Portfolio in September 2015 as a new service to the members of my trading room, and began to buy mining stocks which looked to have bottomed. I think we all know how that turned out.

In fact, I wrote this in public articles at the end of 2015:

""As we move into 2016, I believe there is a greater than 80% probability that we finally see a long term bottom formed in the metals and miners and the long term bull market resumes. Those that followed our advice in 2011, and moved out of this market for the correction we expected, are now moving back into this market as we approach the long term bottom. In 2011, before gold even topped, we set our ideal target for this correction in the $700-$1,000 region in gold. We are now reaching our ideal target region, and the pattern we have developed over the last 4 years is just about complete. . . For those interested in my advice, I would highly suggest you start moving back into this market with your long term money . . .""

So, for me, it is all about what the market is telling me from an objective standpoint. Remember, we have been strongly, and correctly, bullish the stock market when many others have been quite bearish, especially in early 2016, when we were looking for a test of the 1800 region before we expected the market to rally to 2600+. And, that has served us quite well.

While I certainly could not foresee the complex moving sideways for almost two years (as I am only an analyst and not a prophet), at least for now I will have to retain a bullish bias of the GLD for as long as the 119 region holds as support. And, it looks like the next few weeks will tell us if the market will follow through on this pattern or not. Should we see such follow through, it will likely take most by surprise, as they have been lulled to sleep over the last two years by the price action in the complex. Yet, this is how markets seem to work. The train often leaves the station with the fewest possible passengers aboard. And, then, as they say, the chase is on.

"The following is the summary from my blog: [http://zenanalyst.com/2018/06/24/weekly-review-6-22-2018/](http://zenanalyst.com/2018/06/24/weekly-review-6-22-2018/)

The week began with 2 quiet trading days, which I took advantage of by reading general tech news (and learning how to sous vide but that’s for another blog). There were many interesting tech articles out last weekend and this week, especially in AI, which remains one of the hottest topic among tech investors. See my daily notes for links.

Then on Tuesday, after the close, ORCL reported decent earnings but issued weak next-quarter guidance and analysts raised questions on the health of its cloud business as the company decided not to disclose cloud revenues. ORCL traded down 7.5&amp;#37; on Wednesday. After that, RHT reported on Thursday after the close, which really set the tech market on fire. While most head-line metrics looked OK, RHT posted weaker-than-expected billings (+12&amp;#37; y/y vs. +15&amp;#37; y/y) and management lowered its FY guidance due to FX headwinds. In addition, management disclosed that the contract renewal pool is down y/y, which implies a headwind for near-term billings. The stock fell in the mid-teens on Friday.

The two weak tech earnings came at a time of increasing concern around tech valuation, especially software / SaaS names. For example, there were multiple valuation-drive downgrades on Thursday, including CHGG and ELLI. So in conclusion, it looks to me that we are at the start of a tech correction that may last for a 5 trading days or more. Of course, no one knows exactly what will happens, which is why tech investors have their eyes glued on the event / earnings calendar as well as keeping an eye on the health of the IPO market. By my count, there are 12 IPOs scheduled for this week.

"This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

"These are the latest Schedule 13D forms filed by activist investors in the last 7 days. Activist
investors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.
There is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.
Schedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management
(such as Index funds).

There is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize
is that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.
The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.
In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

## New Filings
This table lists new 13D filings in the last week. A new filing does not necessarily indicate a new position,
as investors frequently accumulate in advance before reaching the filing threshold.

"Hey all, newbie to trading here. I got myself a few books on technical analysis and just downloaded ninja trader 7.  Looking to get nice and comfy paper trading before trying my hand at the real thing.

I want to test the strategies I will be learning on actual market data instead of simulated data, however it looks like the free trial data stream you get with ninja trader doesn't include data from the DOW, TSX or NASDAQ.

Forgive my noobishness please I have a few questions:

1. I am fairly young and will not have that much capitol to work with. My account will likely be starting off at something like 5k. Given this, what instruments should I even look at trading? 

2. How could I get either live data or historical data for the instruments in question 1?",What should I practice trading?,StockMarket,1

"A friend of mine, who´s saying he works on the baseline pricing models of options told me that option prices are always rising before the release of new numbers/statements from the underlying company. He´s arguing that this is because volatility risises and  therefore the option price must rise too.

"**Which stock titles will profit from the people's increasing need for privacy, encryption and anonymity?**

Background of my question: I am convinced that privacy and anonymity in the classical sense are currently extremely under-valuated. I expect a situation in the long-term future where consumers and companies will realize the true value of privacy and encryption (similar to the recent Facebook outrage, but on a much larger scale). Which stocks will profit from such a ""privacy boom"" most likely in the long run? I would like to setup a ""privacy portfolio"", and have thought about:

* Symantec (classical AV provider with lots of knowledge about security threats)
* Apple (have gone into opposition against US authorities despite claims to decrypt their services and devices)
* Deutsche Telekom (German ISP who is used by Microsoft as a substitute cloud provider to keep the US government off German companies)
* Providers of on-premise IT services (anti public cloud movement)

Thanks for views.

"There has been a decline in sole proprietorships, partnerships, and overall business creation in America as the economy has become less dynamic. I wouldn’t say the high valuations are justified by the decline in small business and rise of big businesses, but they certainly are explained. 

Another catalyst besides the weakness in business creation is the invention of 401K funds. The law which made retirement investing tax free was passed in 1978. Since these 401K plans were technically a loophole in the tax law, it took until the 1980s for them to be popularized. America has gone through a financial revolution in the past 50 years. First retirement accounts promoted more investing for retirement and then ETFs allowed everyone to get access to the whole market for a low fee.

With the volatility of these stocks these days it’s kinda crazy. I personally bought in on HUYA and IQ somewhat early so these ups and downs aren’t killing me but I was wondering what you guys were thinking about the futures of these. I am personally very interested in HUYA since Fortnite will come out in China on Monday (twitch blew up with fortnite).,"Thoughts on HUYA, IQ, and SOGO?",StockMarket,1
"I recently invested 1000$ into stocks. The stock has risen, and right now my gains are about 700$. I also had 300 floating from bonds I used to own which I sold a while ago. I haven't touched those 300 at all and was thinking of investing that and then some into another similar market stock which has a lower stock price at the moment.

However the buying power tab is telling me that I currently have 1000$ buying power. How is this possible? Is it letting me re-invest my gains from the other stocks into more stock? Why do I not have simply 300$ and rather have the sum of both as my available purchasing power. I definitely need to get more educated about what i'm doing here, but I dabbled into this casually. I just wanted to buy for another 1k a different stock, needed to add cash first to make my balance &gt; 300, yet I see my buying power would allow me to bypass that.

I just need to know what this money is before I make my moves. ",New to stock market. Why is my buying power higher than my withdrawal balance?,StockMarket,1
"I’m a thematic investor and the timing couldn’t have been better with this one. With an analytics background academically I recently joined the workforce and realized how data science is prevalent in large enterprises, everybody trying to do their best with all the information they have but a major bottleneck is talent. Not everyone could code. Lack of tech talent was forcing business focussed employees to get hands dirty with data manipulation and self service drag and drop tools were being used widely. A similar need for better visualization drove DATA and I feel AYX might benefit from this too. Over the next 5 years this transition will be huge, add to that the possibility for AYX of a takeout by bigger enterprise SaaS names. Thoughts?

"I've been watching the stock for a few months and it's dropped a lot recently. I did a bit of research into it and it doesn't seem like the company is doing too bad. The price drop seems to be due to a ""reverse stock split,"" and to be quite frank, I've got no idea what that means. The 52 week high is $62.70 and it's sitting at $3.40 right now. Does this have potential?",Achieve Life Sciences (ACHV) a good buy?,StockMarket,1
"I've been recently set up with an account on the market with Fidelity. As I've learned more, I've also heard that it's not the best platform. Because I have a ""low"" ammount of capital (~6,500 if I sell), I've started learning about options. I want to increase my chances as much as possible and I was wondering if transferring into ToS would be a good idea.

How do these offerings usually play out?",Trading secondary offerings,StockMarket,1
"(CNBC) General Electric shares were lower early Wednesday, a day after news that the industrial conglomerate would be replaced on the Dow Jones industrial average by Walgreens Boots Alliance.

Now to me, I think this is a good thing. They no longer have to worry about keeping a track record of being a Dow company. They can breathe and fix themselves. Without needing to please others, which they should have been doing all along. And I think they have already begun based on the most recent interview with the CEO. 

Also, this is a perfect example as to why short-term news doesn't matter. Let's think about this. Does begin dropped from the DOW affect GE's operating business at all? No. Will it have an impact on the operating performance of the future? No.

But I get it. Everyone would rather be a part of the club than being kicked out of it. But this has no effect on GE's business so to me it's all just noise.

What is on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/StockMarket?

*****

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Wednesday, June 20th, 2018! :)**",(6/20) - Wednesday's Stock Movers &amp; News,StockMarket,1
"**Hello!**  
I am /r/lykosen11 and I recently have been looking at some young fast international growers, and after looking at a few, I decided to deep dive. Here is my writeup of my fundamental DCF and business analysis of BEST INC.

______________________________________________________________________________

**The Business**  

BEST INC. is a China based Smart Supply chain service company, which uses multiple platforms to create an easy way for new as well as old businesses to flourish without having to worry about logistics. They have a multitude of different platforms and aim  to integrate technology with everything from parcel handling in warehouses to local smart stores, as well as everything moving in between. Because of the macroeconomic situation over in China, the company's market is growing by the quarter with new businesses that want to take a foothold in the market, but need to offload the immense work that is infrastructure, logistics and the design of those.

The BEST Cloud services uses data to help businesses pick out route assignments, optimal partner selections, inventory management, fulfillment planning and methods to optimize all these. The business is sold as SaaS, and reap the benefits from that business model (great margins, recurring revenue, etc).

Their shipping businesses, BEST Freight and Best Express handle cargo and parcels respectively. They use a per package payment method to sell their immense distribution network to other businesses. They hold almost 5 million square meters of warehouse space and while a majority is located within china, they offer services out of the country as well. Germany, Australia, USA, Japan and Canada all have their distribution centers, and they are looking to expand into Thailand, Spain, Korea and Taiwan.

Last but not least, they have their newest service, the BEST STORE+, which is a local store business they use to get the last mile fulfillment done, the hardest part of the business. Stores where sales can be made, while sending, receiving and handling shipping for parcels can efficiently be done. It is fairly new, and is growing very very well.
_______________________________________________________________________________________

**Growth &amp; Financials**  
The business today is growing by roughly 50%, but as they had their IPO last year very little can be assumed. They are growing their parcel fulfillment volume at roughly 60%, while the chinese shipping market is only growing 30% (both Y/Y). They today hold over 375 thousand membership stores, with 452 brands within. They currently hold 9.6% of the shipping market now in Q118, which is up from 7.5% Q1 last year, which means that they are taking additional market share in a growing market. 

They are currently holding $480 million NET cash, with debt exceptionally low for a growing logistics company. During 2017, they had a revenue of $3 Billions, and according to their guidance 2018 will be roughly 51% higher, at $4.47 Billions. They use this revenue to finance their growth and the increasing cost of labor, and right now they are not profitable. Their net loss in 2017 was $189 million. In 2017 however they held their first positive gross margin, a fantastic sign, at 2.4%. Along this however, they have a -6.4% operating margin and -6.14% net margin, as their financial income is positive.

[Here is a revenue breakdown for those intrested.](https://imgur.com/a/maLSNYL)

_______________________________________________________________________________________

**Modelling &amp; My Thoughts**  
The model for a company like this becomes fairly sketchy, as very little historical data is available. Using some number crunching you can figure out quite a bit however, and you need to have some numbers to back up your thesis in my eyes. My financial model for $BSTI assumes that the net loss peaks at 2023, while their margins grow. When analyzing the prospects of a unprofitable growth story, you have to assume something, but it is important to be bordering pessimistic to get a realistic view. It is easy to create what you want to find in these cases. I assume that the revenue growth has peaked, and wil fall up ad infinitum at roughly 2-4% rate. I do however think their margins will keep growing at the same rate they have been, up to a gross margin of 8%. This number is low, however, it is to hard to predict anything except small cumulative growth. 

I think this is a very young growth story, at a market cap of not even 5 billion USD, to be less than 10 years since the company was founded and 1 year off IPO. It makes it very hard to predict what will happen, and it is made even more difficult by the Chinese development story. I have attempted to offset this but not assuming to optimistic scenarios, as well as attaching a high discount rate (9%) and maturity (-3%) to reflect the risks. That said, it does not make the stock a less risky pick. The non-financial growth numbers look fantastic, and they outperform/match the financial numbers, which indicates that the company has natural growth. If they are ever put in the position where they can use their pricing power from their high-tech services, they can really flourish. That combined with the strong partnerships they hold, with Bank of China, Visa, Mastercard and Alibaba, makes them very very strong. 

There is tons of risk as the business is very capital heavy, with over extensions in their logistics network ([similar to the risk with JD](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lykosen/comments/8orunk/answer_jdcom_risks_summary/)), strong competitors (although none which employ as much IT/DATA technology in their services), and bad current margins. However,  there is much to like as well. Strong net cash position, immense natural growth, growing faster than the fast growing market as well as China develops, a lot of business will be made and all of them will need logistics.

_______________________________________________________________________________________

**My Verdict**  
My model is very sporadic, which makes price targets irrelevant. However, since a lot of people like it for my bottom line, here it is: 27 USD. 129% upside. I made different models for each scenario, optimistics scenarios, scenarios where growth slow down but they adapt with pricing, pessimistic scenarios, scenarios where they fail to improve their margins because of competition, etc. I then analyse what I think is the probability of each scenario so I can create the model I believe in the most. The assumptions I made for this ""Realism"" model are the numbers I used in the main text.

Logistics is a tough business, and normally growth is fairly slow and expensive. I must say however I respect immensely how BEST is paying for their growth up front and not with debt. I also like that they have strong allies that are friendly with the local government, which makes them more government-proof (always a risk with China). I like seeing that they take more market share as the quarters come and go, as well as they are growing their by far highest margin business, their Store+, the fastest at 74%. A lot of other good companies like Amazon, Apple and Microsoft have done the same with AWS, Apple Services and Microsoft cloud services. Growing fast in high margin businesses is the optimal way to high earnings, and when BEST INC gets any earnings whatsoever, I believe they will be strong. That said, this is a slow story, and it will take a while before that point is reached. I buy $BSTI knowing that they might not move much this year even, but when they start moving I want to be a shareholder. Know the risks though.

https://infographic.statista.com/normal/chartoftheday_15334_amazon_long_term_return_n.jpg

 Amazon’s share price reached yet another historic high on Tuesday, briefly pushing the company’s market capitalization beyond $1 trillion. Despite the fact that Amazon’s valuation had fallen back to $995 billion by the end of the trading day, it is only a matter of time before the e-commerce giant joins Apple in the trillion dollar club.

Amazon has been on a bull run for a while now, with its share price more than quadrupling over the past three years alone. While Amazon shares have looked like a very good investment for the better part of the 21 years since the company’s IPO, the past five years really have been the icing on the cake.

Anyone smart, patient or just lucky enough to have bought Amazon shares in the company’s 1997 IPO and kept them, can now look at a small or (depending on the initial investment) sizeable fortune. As our chart illustrates, an initial investment of $180, enough to buy 10 shares in May 1997, would now be worth more than $240,000. Next to the stock price’s climb from $18 to more than $2,000, the huge return on investment can be attributed to three stock splits, which turned one share bought in 1997 into twelve shares by the end of 1999.

"I've decided to get into trading. It's something I've always had a knack for(markets in gaming, general trend spotting in jobs, etc), and I've decided to seriously get to learning.  


Meanwhile, to give myself both some dopamine highs and some reality crashing lows, I'd like to occasionally throw a very small amount of money at a stock or three here and there every paycheck or two to supplement paper trades.   


I'm not really a big fan of the overall platform on Robinhood(though it's definitely good). I'd like to find something with a little more serious style, but something that works with a very low(or zero) minimum deposit that isn't too killer on fees. As I'm brand new to this world, it's hard to tell the fakes from the real deal, and the worths from the very clearly not worths.   


I looked around at a few and kept finding random fine print I didn't enjoy, and so I think picking one for myself to supplement my curiosity while I learn is going to be tough. I'd love some advice.  


I'm assuming it would mostly be stocks, though Forex and anything else doesn't look awful either. I'm mostly just learning charts and trends and want to have applied learning the whole way up my climb as a budding trader.

"Technically, followers of CAPE would say stocks should almost always be bought except when the CAPE ratio is very high like now. While that’s a fair point, the fact that the Shiller PE has been higher than its historical median for most of the past few decades seems to suggest there have been changing market dynamics which make it less relevant.

The biggest assumption CAPE makes is that margins will fall. There’s debate whether this is cyclical action or mean reversion. Either way, the current record margins are projected to decline. Investors fear when anyone says ‘this time is different’, but it’s fair to question if the high margins the tech sector has produced must fall just because margins in other industries did so in the past.

"Hello,

I was banned last week from /ripple for pointing this out.  

There is currently ~39.5 billion XRP in circulation.

Out of that 39.5 billion XRP almost half of that is owned by a small handful of individuals that helped start Ripple.

Jeb McCaleb owns ~9 billion, almost 25% of the circulating supply.  He has an agreement in place that keeps him from selling a small minute amount each month.  It's important to note that at year 5 and 6 he is allowed to sell 1 billion and 2 billion XRP per year (Hello price crash).

Chris Larsen owns ~5.2 billion.

The next part gets shaky and I'll be the first to admit but even if the following individuals own a negligible amount, it should be noted that between McCaleb and Larsen own ~35% of the total supply of XRP.

Brad Garlinghouse the CEO of Ripple is said to own a substantial amount. Enough to vault him to 54th place on Forbes billionaire list.  I have no idea what this would equate to in XRP holdings but it HAS to be a substantial amount.  

The next are the other founders of XRP, we have no idea how much XRP these guys own.

- Arthur Britto
- David Schwartz 
- Ryan Fugger

It's very important to note we have NO IDEA how much XRP that Garlinghouse, Britto, Schwartz, or Fugger own cumulatively.

Without even taking what those four individuals into consideration the total amount of circulating XRP owned by past and present Ripple employees stands at 35 % of total circulating supply PLUS what those four individuals own.

What is decentralization?

Decentralization - the dispersion of distribution of functions and powers.

Garlinghouse and Schwartz have recently argued that XRP is decentralized.  I'd agree that the XRP network in itself is decentralized but when a small number of individuals are wielding the majority of the supply, than the power of that coin is not decentralized. 

What happens when Jeb McCaleb is able to sell his billions of XRP in a single year, hello sell wall.

For that matter, what happens when any of the above individuals decide to sell their XRP at the same time?

I'd also like to note, and this is well known in the XRP community, that the price of XRP remains 'mysteriously' stable at times.  Even now, the rest of the market shifts and XRP stays the same price.  It's been like that for as long as I've held the token.

So I'll let the community be the judge as I am censored from /ripple.  

A small handful of individuals owning what could amount to at best 35% of a coins total supply (at worse it could be well over 50% of the total supply) equate to a decentralized digital asset?

Product: Overledger , Quant Health , GoVerify

Overledger:  
Overledger is the blockchain operating system that enables interoperability between blockchains and connects the world’s existing networks and the Internet to blockchain.

Overledger encourages innovation by allowing developers to build applications across multiple ledgers or multi-chain applications (MApps), meaning that developers can harness the power of multiple individual blockchains to build the most effective solution instead of being confined to just one (‘single-ledger dependency’). Overledger not only enables blockchain-to-blockchain communication, it also takes things a step further and seamlessly connects existing networks and the Internet to blockchain, allowing Enterprises to harness the power of blockchain to address real-world challenges.

Overledger is already connect to: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and Hyperledger network. Of course way more to come.

This means a ledger, app (mapp) , company or any IoT device can be deployed, connected and function on every chain and real world internet as we know it today.

Quant Health: More info to come with new website. (this month's rebranding) They already had meetings with for example the department of Health (London) and more.

GoVerify: GoVerify is a new system to verify if a caller, texter or emailer is the legit person behind this. They already are deploying this on banks and there is a huge demand for it. Trusttag so to call.

Partners: As stated, We have more than one fortune 500/FTSE 100 company signed. We are going to the press release cycle now. They work with Governments, Lloyd's bank and China's ministry of Commerce and more governments.  
Also if seen here under Gilbert Verdian has a patented ISO Standard were 44 governments work with.

* *Quant Network and the JBI have signed a MoU for a five-year cooperation.*
* *Overledger is the only platform to facilitate internet-scale development and deployment of decentralised, multi-chain applications (MApps) and Treaty Contracts (multi-chain smart contracts)*

Gilbert Verdian:  
""Gilbert is a technologist with an upbringing in business and a deep background in technology and security.

Having over 20 years of industry experience he has worked across Government in Downing St, HM Treasury, Cabinet Office, Ministry of Justice and NSW Health and private sector at CSC, EY, HSBC and BP.

Having a keen interest in disruptive technology, he’s the founder of the Blockchain ISO Standard TC307 and is the Chair of the UK’s national committee on Blockchain and Distributed Ledger technologies (DLT/1).

He’s actively working to advance technology in the areas of AI, Cybersecurity, Blockchain and FinTech.""

Paolo Tasca:

""Paolo Tasca is a Digital Economist, an expert on digital innovation with salient expertise on Blockchain technologies and Complex Systems.

We stand on the brink of a fourth industrial revolution, which will fundamentally alter the way we live, work, and relate to one another. New technologies are dramatically transforming our economic systems, and our society in general, into something very different from what we were used to thinking about over the last few decades.""

Colin Paterson:  
""Colin is a technology innovator with a background in Information, Cybersecurity and AI.

He calls on his years of cross sector experience in; Health, Defence, Finance and Utilities combined with his passion for new and emergent technologies to solve real world problems.  
Working to democratise blockchain development he is seeking along with the other founders of Quant to help developers unchain the full potential of ledger technologies.""

The team has connections over the whole world, aiming to be the most enterprise experienced team in the crypto space. They have spoken with many company's like PwC and such. On the telegram you can find much more answers of them, and they are very active (outside the Telegram). Every monday the team joins telegram to answer all questions. (AMA)

"After noticing that Bitcoin kind of bottomed out at ~5000 euros I finally decided it was time to buy more. I made a transfer from my bank to my Coinbase account and, before the money arrived, surely enough, Bitcoin started rising consistently again. I decided I’d wait for the next dip to make the purchase. 

So now when the price is rising I am happy because of the coins I already have, and if the price drops I will be happy that I can buy again at a “low price”. 

I finally figured out the secret of permanent happiness. ",How to always be happy when investing in crypto,CryptoCurrency,0

"We saw how in 2017 USDT pumped market cap by issuing new tokens, which lead to more fiat money entering into the crypto market. 

&amp;#x200B;

A token that is not volatile on the most volatile market in the world was born in 2015, approximately 7 years after BTC. In June 2015, Tether issued around six mln tokens. Tether’s behavior led to BTC market cap increasing by 5 mln in a month, which at the time was a serious increase.

&amp;#x200B;

During 2015 - 2017, Tether issued more asset-backed tokens pledged to USD. BTC market cap was increasing as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

Market got tripped up because of the human greed. 

At the beginning of the 2017 ICO(scam) boom started, a lot of scammers siphoned billions out of our world of the digital economy. 

They bought Lambos, yachts, huge flats, etc. 

They thought that nothing would happen to them. But the big brother is watching you boys, and it is the decentralised community. There’s nowhere to run. 

&amp;#x200B;

Nowadays, I think that asset-backed tokens could move a lot more fiat money into the market, which will lead to The Big Bang Bull run. 

&amp;#x200B;

There are a lot of asset classes, that might be tokenised. 

Do you have any asset-backed tokens in your portfolio? 

Could you share your experience of acquiring asset-backed tokens, did you purchase them during the ICO or you used the exchanges?

Which of them do you prefer?",Another Big Bang Theory,CryptoCurrency,0

"**The Dunning-Kruger effect**

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Prompted by Wheeler's bank robbery, two researchers from Cornell University, David Dunning and Justin Kruger, began studying the accuracy of self-assessment. They wondered how people could be such poor judges of their own abilities. Their research was published in a 1999 report titled, ""Unskilled and Unaware of It.""   
&gt;  
&gt;This phenomenon can be particularly frustrating for experts. Time and again you will encounter uneducated, untrained, or unskilled people who think, speak, and act as if they are proficient, when they clearly are not. Charles Darwin recognized this phenomenon when he penned, ""Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge.""  
&gt;  
&gt;As an expert you might prefer that the unskilled people around you knew they were unskilled. But this, unfortunately, is not to be. Experts of all stripes should expect unskilled people to have inflated opinions of their own capability. It is, simply, the way it is. Yet too often experts are surprised and even aghast when they encounter the ""unskilled and unaware.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Unfortunately, there is very little an expert can do to quickly reverse the Dunning-Kruger effect. Confronting the novice will not rectify an inflated perception. Telling the untrained that they are untrained more often fosters resentment than cooperation. Pointing out the failings of the beginner will not reduce his opinion of himself, but it will reduce his opinion of you.  
&gt;  
&gt;It turns out that there is one remedy to the Dunning-Kruger effect but it takes time to accomplish. The better trained a person is at a task, the more proficient that person becomes, and the better judge she becomes of her own skill. And, once a person becomes proficient at a skill his perception of his skills becomes more accurate. He also gains an appreciation for the skills of the truly expert.  
&gt;  
&gt;It is almost always the least skilled people who hold the highest degree of illusory superiority. Even the moderately skilled individuals maintain a higher opinion of themselves than is justified. It is only the truly proficient who underestimate their own abilities.

I remember when I read up about bitcoin/alt-coins and started making some early profits, it was all I could talk about on any social event. I thought people who didn't join this great revolution were foolish, it was a 'once in a lifetime' and the only direction was up. A few friends joined in after I talked about it, mostly because of my confidence on 'how this is the next big thing and can only grow from here'. Some started immediately and made some profits, most lagged in and joined right when mass-media began co-chanting my message....right before the bear market. Those friends are down 80% right now. 

During those months/years, I've been learning valuable lessons about the entire cryptocurrency scene and when I found the above mentioned 'Dunning-Kruger' effect, I noticed that I absolutely went through this entire stage (moreso, I'm still going through it). The lessons haven't always been cheap, but that's what you get for being a cocky loudmouth I guess. Crypto IS complicated, and few people even grasp the biggest part of it all. 

Anybody else who has been through this/or is still going through this?

*Europe’s finest up-and-coming comedian is worthy of Ali G in his satirical creation as the head of the fictional ‘Bank of International Settlements’.*

It’s not often that a comedian is brave enough to take on a subject as dry as global banking, but Agustin Carstens — a previously little-known performance artist from Mexico — has successfully done just that. For the last several months, Carstens has been touring Europe, remaining in-character at all times, delivering weighty speeches about the perils facing the global economy from an irresponsible younger generation obsessed with digital cash. We were recently able to take in one of his gigs — and were absolutely blown away by his act.

The genius of Carstens is not in his deadpan delivery — a style long employed by comedians, perhaps most notably the UK’s Jack Dee. It is the sheer perfection with which he walks the unlikely line he has chosen. Watching him perform, unsuspecting audiences are left with the distinct impression that Carstens genuinely believes his own message, and are uncertain whether they should be laughing with him or at him: an unsettling but simultaneously riotously hilarious experience. Just as Sacha Baron Cohen immersed himself in his comic creation [Ali G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_G) — the ‘gangster from Staines’ who mocked his guests and their desperation to come across well to the public by inducing them to agree to his own shocking or ridiculous views — so Carstens takes the role of Head of the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) to a new level of post-ironic satire.

&gt;*‘Carstens is simply superb as the “Head of the BIS”… His figure is larger-than-life, his demeanour entitled, his message strident, his tone increasingly desperate — his comic creation faultless.’*  
*- Cassius (writer and entertainment critic)*

\--------------------------------------

During the course of his ‘presentations’ — delivered to journalists and groups of notable figures from the world of finance and economics — Carstens never once slips out of character, as he harangues the world beyond the cameras about the dangers of digital money and the new economic paradigms it represents. In doing so, he poses the wickedly funny question to the nascent industry he addresses: ‘How dare you try to muscle in on the profits of injustice the banks have monopolised for a hundred years?’

Take this excerpt of one of his most recent interviews, given to the journalist of a major Basel news outlet (the journalist, naturally, is unaware of the comedic nature of Carstens’ endeavour, tacitly accepting the existence of the fictional BIS and thereby flaunting his ignorance of the global economics it is his job to cover). ‘My message to young people would be: Stop trying to create money! … Young people should use their many talents and skills for innovation, not reinventing money. It’s a fallacy to think money can be created from nothing.’

​

With a nod to[ South Park’s Mr Mackey (‘Crypto is bad, mkay?’)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uh7l8dx-h8M), Carstens pleads with the youth of today to give up their naive ways of creating money from nothing. And, like Mr Mackey, who ignores his own classroom diatribe and plunges himself into a lifestyle of drug-taking, Carstens smoothly glosses over the hypocrisy of the world’s central banks, for whom he is the central figure. With the effects of the Global Financial Crisis still undermining the prosperity of ordinary people — and precisely the younger generation he lectures bearing the brunt of the pain they are innocent of causing — the head of the BIS knows better than anyone that central banks have hardly acquitted themselves well. But ‘Central banks are trusted,’ he comments — his composure never once faltering with so much as a smirk at the irony.

#### It is this incisive, biting wit framed by his utterly convincing delivery that makes Carstens the rising star he is and the comedy great he is destined to become. From his evident depth of knowledge of economics (from which he naturally cherry-picks only the most convenient facts for his message) to his imposing physical presence and image as the stereotypical bankster, his commitment to his character is absolute.

Agustin, we salute you!

" I was reading recently on the unbanked population in the world and I was shocked to find out that around 2 Billion adults are unbanked worldwide. 

&amp;#x200B;

 To clarify, being unbanked in the 21st century means that you are unable to have credit score or apply for loans or do any other service you expect to do in the modern 21st century world. This means that the old grandma or the farmer living in 3rd world countries are all unaddressed markets. These people depend on microloans which would have to be paid in around a week at 95% interest rate or something ridiculous like that.  

&amp;#x200B;

 Surely I thought, someone is trying to address this market. I was not wrong there. After some research I came through a few projects. I will just be talking about one here as it already has a real world use case agreement with one Government which makes it closer to reality than many other projects.    

&amp;#x200B;

This was when I came across Sentinel Chain and read their recent Medium post explaining the project. Simply stated ""To deliver sustainable win-win scenarios for all our stakeholders by bringing financial inclusion at speed and scale through disruptive technologies""  

&amp;#x200B;

Sentinel Chain addresses the Unbanked by targeting the livestock as collateral for Banking services. The incentivize the unbanked to utilize their current assets which will be labeled and tracked with RFID tags verify ownership and existence of the livestock which is the to be used as collateral. This allows the unbanked to proceed and use banking services (such as Savings, epayments, credit, investments, and insurance).  

&amp;#x200B;

 A clearer example with the use cases of Sentinel Chain can be seen in their recent Medium Post ",Sentinel Chain attempts to Bank the Unbanked,CryptoCurrency,0

"So. I had the most amazing thought on how our daily lives could be changing in the near future while trying to describe cryptocurreny and distributed ledger to a friend last night. The subject started at the basics of blockchain and ended talking about the power of micropayments and smart contracts. 

What got me so excited and blew my mind was the revelation on the possibilities of monetizing microtransactions in driverless cars. See i am of the belief that in the not too distant future autonimous driving will be pushed on us by car manufactures, insurance agencies and the government (much deeper than the conversation here, but sets the stage for the next thought). When we are all being shuttled around by our cars traffic and speed limits will be less of a concern. My thought ght is that cars communicating with one another on a ledger network will operate like packets of information, just speeding along like cars of a train. Ok. Heres the mind blowing idea:

If i decide i need to get to my destination faster i have to incentivize you to cut in front of you. My car pays you a fraction of an iota (for instance) and i jump in front of you. Taken further, when i get in my car i set my priority for getting from point a to b  if i need to get there double quick i essentially pay everyone along the drive for the bemefit of passing them. 

I pay you to pass you, you get to where your going and look for abplace to park, your car parks by a neighbors house (cuz all other spots are taken) so your car pays them to park there...its this entire economy of micro transactions i hadnt even considered. 

Anyway. Maybe you all have already thought of this but i hadnt. I font know if the prospect makes me excited or fearful. But i do see how it could work and how ingrained crypto will become as a part of our daily lives.

"🧠  Lisk Sidechain GNY.io opens ICO with a Cointelegraph Announcement!  🧠

The five big takeaways from this Reddit announcement post and the reasons I am interested in this project include.... 

(1) It is not a fork. It's actually a real Lisk sidechain. 

(2) Lisk funds collected during the GNY ICO will be locked up, thus making Lisk tokens rarer, and you know what usually happens to the price of something rare. 

(3) You will be investing in a new blockchain, not one built on ETH etc. 

(4) The Child Rescue Coalition charity which rescues victimized children will have no transaction fees for use of the GNY machine learning blockchain in their quest to track down predators. 

(5) Using Lisk as payment when taking part in the GNY ICO will result in you gaining tokens in two machine learning blockchain projects. So say if you were just invested in Lisk, and you then went and invested some of your Lisk into the GNY ICO, it would mean you end up invested in three projects (Lisk, GNY, and a Lisk sidechain with machine learning capabilities); thus deversifying your portfolio somewhat.",🧠 Lisk Sidechain GNY.io opens ICO with a Cointelegraph Announcement! 🧠,CryptoCurrency,0

"A friend with very basic crypto and tax information asked me if he is supposed to pay tax or not for below scenario. I said definitely Yes. But he thinks because he didn’t receive tax forms from his exchange, then it means No Tax. This made me doubt my answer too. Would you please comment with your idea if he is supposed to pay tax or not and if yes, why he didn’t receive any tax form from his US based exchange company.

(I simplified numbers)
September 2017 He bought 20 Bitcoins for $50,000
October 2017 He sold 20 Bitcoins for $100,000.
November 2017 He could buy only 10 Bitcoins for $100,000, so he bought it.
End of December 2017 His 10 Bitcoins just worth $50,000.
January until August 2018 His 10 Bitcoins still worth only around $50,000 and he didn’t touch them (buy or sell anymore)

What I say is he made $50,000 (and used it to buy Bitcoin) in 2017 and he gotta pay tax
He says he DID NOT cash out the money from exchange and he used it to buy back Bitcoin and literally whatever he made is already lost IF HE SELLS HIS BITCOINS NOW. Actually he is in deficit now. I mean if sells his 10 Bitcoin today, he doesn’t even get $50,000 back but he would get around $30,000.",Tax or No Tax,CryptoCurrency,0

"Sharing the content of the infographic from [https://www.bitcoindesigned.com/infographics/privacy-and-bitcoin/](https://www.bitcoindesigned.com/infographics/privacy-and-bitcoin/) where it was originally posted.

​

**1. Personal risk**

If everyone knows how much money you have, criminals can decide that you are a worthy target to be attacked for your money.

If you are lucky, the attack will only be digital but, in many known cases, it gets physical as well.

This puts you and your loved ones at great risk.

​

**2. Targeted ads**

If your finances are easily followed and, let's say, sold to advertising agencies that show you ads based on your spendings, other people besides yourself might end up seeing these ads and learning what you are buying.

Even with legal harmless stuff, it might be a liking or a need that you'd prefer to keep private.

There's actually a real life example of a father learning his daughter was pregnant because of the ads that were directed to her.

​

**3. Business privacy**

For a business, having your finances transparent and available to anyone can cause serious damage.

Imagine if your competitors knew all about your revenues, margins, suppliers, the salaries of your employers, etc.

​

**4. Commercial leverage**

What if a company knew that you had a lot of money and wouldn't hurt you to pay three times the price they usually charge on a product?

They could easily show ""special prices"" for you on their e-commerce website based on how much they think you're going to pay.

​

**5. Miner censorship**

If your address is easily found and connected to you, miners can join forces to censor your transactions by actively not adding it to their proposed block.

Why would they do that? For numerous reasons, including government pressure, business interest or just wanting to see the world burn.

​

**6. Fungibility**

Good money has to be fungible, that is, all ""chunks"" of money have to be equally accepted no matter its origin.

That is the reality with cash. No one can refuse your cash or try to prosecute you just because the person who paid you got the money selling drugs.

If it weren't fungible, every bill would effectively be worth a different value (dirty notes would be worth less than clean ones) and the money wouldn't work.",Why privacy of cryptocurrency matters?,CryptoCurrency,0

"Bip47 allows a payment reciever to send a reusable code to a sender that allows the sender to privately create a new address to send crypto on-chain.

OpenCAP is a protocol that allows a reciever to associate an address (or payment code :) with a human readable alias, like mine: ""donate$ogdolo.com"". 

Combined these improvements allow users to send and receive transactions privately while also allowing wallets to offer a ""cash app"" experience. We can have human readable contact lists in out wallets!

For more info check out the GitHub:
https://GitHub.com/OpenCAP/protocol

Or a free to use implementation:

We still needs wallets to integrate with the OpenCAP protocol, if you have a favorite wallet let them know. I'm not a wallet dev, I'm a backend guy, but I would be willing to assist with any integrations.

"Hello /r/CryptoCurrency readers,

&amp;#x200B;

My team is looking for someone that is all about cryptocurrencies. This subreddit seems the place to be for this request! I think there should be a few people on this subreddit with the right mindset and experience in crypto. Anyways, we've been in the crypto scene for quite some time and we reached the point where we're lacking innovation and creativity. It would be great to see things from another person's perspective. We also just don't really have the time on our hands anymore to keep up with all the new projects that are being launched. So we're also looking for someone with experience in the ICO atmosphere, that could research ICOs and find us the next ICON or Wanchain for example. 

&amp;#x200B;

We're looking for an experienced, dedicated and motivated ICO researcher/investor that will find us upcoming projects, so we can analyse the team and the whitepaper and look if we have connections within that project. If there's enough demand within the team we can try to negotiate a deal for the private presale. 

&amp;#x200B;

You must be 18+, have a (very) good knowledge of the English language, have at least 5 months experience in crypto/ICOs and be able to have meetings multiple times a week (online). If you do not meet the age or experience requirement, convince me why you're still suitable for the job. We prefer someone with experience in investing in stocks/real estate and/or with a business/computer science/IT education. Your benefit lies in the fact that you'll build up international connections and will be able to participate in the early stages of ICOs, rather than attending public token sales.

&amp;#x200B;

If you're interested, send me a PM and let me know who you are and what your past ICOs are for example, so we can get to know each other and find out if there's a match. Thank you for reading and I'm looking forward to your PM!

"I understand this argument. First off, it's wrong, because my grandma has no idea what Bitcoin is, and actually, the majority of people I talk to over 25 still don't know what it is.

Still, let's assume people who say this are *correct*. We now live in a world where everyone knows what Bitcoin is, and hopefully understands a little about alt-coins, or at least that there are competitors to Bitcoin that will be able to scale to handle the masses.

Well, as many have stated, the market growth of cryptocurrency has mostly been speculative growth, and very little natural growth. What I mean by that is that very few people in the space are using crypto for every day monetary transactions and are using it as a stock or a store of value (sorry guys, this is not the sole purpose of cryptocurrency.)

The only people who have used crypto as it was meant to, and have spurred the first natural growth of Bitcoin were the people using it on the Onion net, people like Overstock using it to get rid of fees, Bitwage using it to get rid of ACH fees, Bitpay, purse.io, etc.

Real market growth in the cryptocurrency space will happen when using cryptocurrency becomes a *necessity*. When a market crash causes printing of money and hyperinflation, or when a foreign bank decides to start spending the USD they have and in turn introduce a lot more circulating USD to the market, causing the buying power of the dollar to crash, *hard.* Listen to people like Peter Schiff to understand what I mean. People like him are predicting one of these to happen in the next 6ish years. He says buy gold, but whatever.

We're seeing this on a smaller scale in Venezuela. *Necessity* has driven people to adopt crypto, and there's a flourishing black/gray market because of it. In Venezuela, from what I've heard, people don't even know about crypto, or at least know of it only in passing.

Imagine, now, that something Venezula-like would happen to the USD or Euro, GBP, etc, *and* everyone's grandma knew about crypto! Usage would absolutely skyrocket as people's trust of fiat was shattered. At that point, you would have *natural*, *organic* growth, and even attempts to regulate crypto would not affect the price, because it's no longer a speculation commodity, but an actual currency being used as a replacement of fiat.","""Everyone and their grandma knows about Bitcoin.

"Back when I started mining in December and January, I had no idea what I was doing... As most of us, I started throwing shit around to see what works and what didn't. During that process, I was creating accounts, wallets, 2fa... At the time, I wasn't sure how to store that information without the risk of losing it. (2fa codes, seeds, private key) So, I threw them on my Google drive in random places. Fast forward 3 months, I got a hardware wallet and moved the majority of my assets there...

Since January, my Mining rig has grown from 1 card to 12, along with some cpu mining and Storj hard drive farming... So, I have rigs spread out everywhere... My problem with that was access to all these rigs... Here comes in Google Remote Desktop... You need signed into Chrome to get that started... When you sign into Chrome, all your shit syncs...

So, anyway... Last Monday I got a text alert from Coinbase with access code... At first I thought it was spam... But, I changed my password anyway... I then went into my Meta Mask to do some house keeping from over the weekend and then I saw.... The outgoing transactions.... The person got my eth, OMG and Storj tokens... I logged into my Nano account and that was empty too... Checked Binance and it was empty too.

All in all, it was 350$ at current prices as of last Monday that was stolen... I'm thankful that 85% of my assets were on the hardware wallet.

I had 2fa phone authorization set up for my Google account, so I'm guessing they gained access to one of my Mining rigs and brought up my Gmail account, searched keywords (I can see that within my activity) and then found info and moved to my Google drive and found everything else they needed.

Since then, I have removed all crypto related stuff out of my drive (thankfully I never put my hardware wallet info there) I also re-set all my 2fa accounts and wrote them down rather than copying. Form there, I've signed out of Chrome on all rigs and Uninstalled it. I've also checked all internet browsers to ensure that I'm not signed in anywhere. If I do have to sign into something, I ensure that it's signed out before I'm out of the rigs.

So, anyway.. Painful lesson to learn.. But, I'm glad to learn it early rather than next year when it could have been worse...

So, make sure your shit is secure and leave no evidence laying around... Make these slum lords work on getting their own shit rather than taking yours.

So if a bull market were to happen and coins like Tron (hypothetically) became worth $10 each, this would create a whole lot of millionaires, where would we be able to trade then withdraw large amounts of AUD?

"Everyday I go into Coinbase and put in a non-executed order for $100, $200, $500, $1000 just to test what the % fee is for the day. At times the fee is 100bps and the spread is low ~ 25bps. At times the fee is 300bps and the spread is high ~ 75bps.

If Coinbase has a demand based fee structure, then this fee is a trailing indicator in general, but a leading indicator that buy pressure is accelerating or decelerating.

Alternatively if the fee is assessed on buys and sells equally (the above paragraph assumed it's not even, more people buy instantly then move to cb pro / gdax to trade at no cost and transfer at no cost) then higher fees deteur selling while lower fees entice buying.

Note that on average the fee is 150bps with a 50bps spread for about 2% on buys. *I never sell on Coinbase, only gdax.*",Theory: Coinbase instant buy fees change based on demand and are an indicator of market direction.,CryptoCurrency,0

"Hi dear Subreddit.

​

I currently am in a very bad place, because most, if not all, of my savings got stolen - I have been mugged, there is no other way to put it.

​

I am still trying to figure out what has happened, however I think I got the hang of it. Despite my time in crypto and my general awareness of security flaws, I have made one big mistake.

My funds were mostly saved on a Ledger Nano S and some on my Exodus wallet (for mining, buying stuff, donating etc.).

It is crucial to understand that I have bought my Ledger and created the Exodus wallet in the first months of me getting into Crypto, and therein lies the mistake.

​

Even though you should NEVER DO THIS, I saved the keywords on my harddrive. I encrypted them with a password and saved them in a protected folder, but I must have forgotten to delete the raw txt files with the keywords on it (as said, one small mistake).

​

On Aug 31st both of my accounts (BTC &amp; ETH on Exodus and BTC &amp; XRP on Ledger) got emptied in a matter of seconds.

​

I know that it was my fault and a very expensive and dumb mistake to make, but back then, I simply was not aware of the danger of seed phrases and simply forgot the raw txt files on my harddrive. A few days ago some sort of malware must have scanned my files and found the seeds. I did not open, display or even have been in the corresponding folder for months (so a keylogger/display logger is highly unlikely to have captured them).

Furthermore my laptop was just sitting at home with nobody but me having access to it.

​

​

To provide some proof, here are the corresponding transactions (as you can see multiple people must have gotten scammed like my):

BTC:

f6fa5f91e7d74f04c01f82b1c5ecbcfcbd0f87306cd6911f78fb38321cffdb19

​

ETH:

0x18b1a3a19b8a2206e20d0228f7adf16085f2c92d039df377a9e6ec23ee7055750x2acc0b6d124f567dda6da18482fc90f05b297509df168b1414cf278fd706e9180x5fa103a3ddf7d6d3264d6a477a321e69add11324a16e53bcb1fc23424d596b94

​

​

I don't know what to do next, but let this be a warning to everyone. Even though it was just about 5000€ and some people got scammed for much more: NOTHING is save. You can try to protect your funds, but making one small mistake can compromise everything you have worked for.

​

I know it was my mistake and I should have known better, but if you want to donate something (of course only if you want to), here are some addresses:

BTC:  17SFvDsoTwPPJnmXWYeLQSXAdN1aGnkMxR 

ETH:  0x12502c85267148643eA6fA654CC7567DD893A25B 

​

​

If you have read my story or even donated one or two bucks I thank you deeply.

"It is very obvious that digital currencies are not well managed when it comes to trading them from the way many exchange platforms have poorly managed the activity. It's not an exaggeration to say this activity is the core factor that determines how well we make use of our assets in the digital world. Quite a lot of contributions and changes have been made or given by many platforms, some came through as the centralized systems while there were others in form of the Decentralized system that have tried to raise the standard of our digital assets trading in order to conquer the overwhelming challenges that persisted. But as they tried, more loop holes are still found and these loop holes still require urgent intervention if the trading activities or operations will become any better or even perfect the way users expected it to be. As issues of securities were combatted, others like lack of transparency sprang up and generally speaking, these constantly rising problems and limitations in the provision of a conducive and perfect exchange networks are making users lose their trust in cryptocurrency as a whole which is not cool at all.

"We are always told that one of the best thing about bitcoin is it’s scarcity. Specifically that there will only ever be a maximum of 21 million bitcoins. All cryptos could be said to have similar properties.  

What I can’t quite get my head around is the significance of this scarcity when each bitcoin can be divided into 100 million satoshis.  We can then say there are 2.1 quadrillion units of bitcoin.  I get that it can’t be printed upon demand and this has great value.  

But can someone help me understand what makes a number like 2.1 quadrillion scarce, in relation to the dollar and gold, and also as it relates to other crypto currencies max token supplies? ",Question re: Crypto Scarcity,CryptoCurrency,0

"DATUM is a decentralized and distributed high performance NoSQL network backed by a blockchain ledger. It allows anyone to securely and anonymously backup structured and input of multiple types of data from social networks, wearable, smart homes, and other IoT devices. The blockchain empowers users by regaining control of how their data gets used and shared. Users are also incentivized to use the network for data storage, not only by privacy but also by monetization incentives. In a nutshell, it provides a marketplace where users can share or sell data on their own terms.

BENEFITS
●Users
They can submit data, these can be personal, collected business data, data from IOT devices or any other data source.
●Storage Nodes
Computer power and storage capacity are provided to miners for efficient storage of data in the decentralized network. Storage Nodes are one of the major pillars that allows Datum to provide global scale storage of submitted data.
●Data Consumers
Users can decide to grant data access selectively or even sell (based on the terms) their data to trusted entities of choice.
Privacy is assured by marking each piece of data in the network with usage terms during the encryption. Through this, the user or the data source can control their data to suit their need. The usage terms are controlled by the DAT token smart contract.

USE CASES

For Email receipts, financial data, Household Device Graphing, KYC Document storage, tokenizing consumer data for enterprises; Datum network is utilized through the following:
A. User submits a piece of data to the Datum Network using the client software. The user pays gas to submit the data. As the data is encrypted, only the user can provide a decryption key to all the interested parties.
B. A Storage Node receives the data and stores the data. The data is replicated to many other storage nodes.
C. A Data Consumer declares interest to purchase the piece of data. The User receives a data purchase request with the details such as purchaser and price offered. He can agree to the purchase request or counter offer with a modified proposal.
D. The User accepts the proposal, the user receives DAT Tokens and the decryption key is sent to the Data Consumer who pays in DAT Tokens.",Datum Introduction.,CryptoCurrency,0
"We really should have a bigger focus on that.

we complain that the evil banks are freezing our accounts, do stuff with our money or take fees for transactions.

this is EXACTLY what every exchange does as well.

There are more and more details about fake volumes on Exchanges. They do that so it becomes more attractive for ICOs to get listed, which leads to higher fees for that listing.

Look at these ridicioulus profits exchanges are making. These profits come from our pockets.

"I wanted to share a trading competition the upcoming exchange Covesting (COV) is going to have. Each participant will be given a predetermined and equal amount of Ethereum and will compete for getting the highest percentage gains within a given time frame. 

It is to promote the trade feature that will be a core part of the Covesting platform which is the copy trade feature. Investors will be able to follow traders using COV tokens as means of entry to ""copy"" the trades of any trader of your choosing. 

I've been following this project for several months. Their professionalism combined with the transparency of their project is exciting. The COV team strives to embrace regulation in order to protect those who use the exchange. They are pursuing the first DLT license from Gibraltar in order to be strictly regulated and audited by new rules and regulations in the cryptocurrency space. This is unlike a vast majority of exchanges out there. Here is a link to their latest update!

"DAX is a decentralized solution for personal data exchange. The platform is designed to connect data owners (individuals) and data consumers (various enterprises, non-profits and research companies). The DAX marketplace will be based on a multi-token architecture. The system will employ three tokens. DAX ERC721 token will be linked to the consumer’s identity as they sign up to claim their data. DAX token will be used to access data, stake insertion orders and redeem rewards. DAX ERC20 token will be offered to investors and act as a registered security.

DAX can also be traded on Indodax exchange. Indodax is one of the major exchanges in Indonesia with a high transaction volume. With the entry of DAX into the Indodax market, it is expected to add token types that can be traded there. And with the high trading volume will make DAX become one of the tokens that are in demand by investors and will have a high selling value in the future.

Hopefully, in the future the project from DAX tokens can be successful and get a place in the hearts of investors. So that it can be one of the choices in investing in cryptocurrency other than coins, altcoins, and tokens that already exist first. And in the end it has a high selling value with more and more enthusiasts from investors and traders around the world. That's a bit about DAX tokens which are one of the cryptocurrency products. Hopefully, it can be a token that is used by the community throughout the world as an investment and trading asset. We always support DAX as one of the famous tokens and has a high selling value.

Oddly enough, they sought to remove content from the web as if to keep things under wraps, yet I can still find some articles that show just how aggressive they've been and how far ahead they are of other projects in the space:[http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF\_Value\_Healthcare\_report\_2018.pdf](http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Value_Healthcare_report_2018.pdf)

Whether 99% of altcoins are shit or not, we all come to the same conclusion, even the ultra-bears who bash Bitcoin daily - blockchain technology is the future. What Enigma is doing with secret contracts, TEE, and if they deliver on MPC (they will if anyone can), the technology and protocol is vital to the blockchain realm itself. Not some random use-case or a product running on a blockchain, but an actual integral component to blockchain itself.

Idk, but I like to follow the money. Pantera Capital invested, Intel publicly associated themselves with a working partnership, the team is actually from MIT and not some random guy who held a seminar in the school's lab once. If they can deliver on their MPC ambitions, I can't see why this isn't a top 20-30 coin all day long and surviving long term. I'm genuinely asking for reasons not to go into Enigma deeper, or why people may be staying away (or if it's just not on the radar yet).

" Hey everyone,  


I'm making a quick survey about investing and researching in crypto. This is a fun little thing i wanted to do for a while, but had little time to create one. Instead of people giving you advice all the time, there needs to be more open community consensus on people's: opinions, actions and emotions in crypto. I ultimately want to help individuals be aware of how other crypto-users behave in this current climate. This survey is for educational purposes only, and will NOT award any crypto-currencies.  


All results are available for public view after you've completed the survey:

"Cryptocurrency exposure is so low that it's futile to even judge cryptocurrencies at this stage. Have a look at the ownership figures below and understand that the US tech bubble and the pre-crisis 2007 highs had over 60% of retail involved.

"**Ray with Constellation at Techcrunch**

The CEO of hello kitty is attending Techcrunch together with the Constellation team. It were earlier leaked that Ray was an advisor to the team, and now it looks like he might be more than just an advisor. 

 

**Why is this important?**

Ray was responsible for taking Hello Kitty from 300m marketcap to 6.5b.

Until recently, Ray was the Managing Director of Sanrio Co., Ltd (owner of the wildly popular Hello Kitty brand), and he had executed Sanrio’s global expansion strategy. He not only made Hello Kitty a global iconic brand, but also succeeded in acquisition of a UK brand named Mr. Men Little Miss and bringing the franchise to Hollywood. As a global strategist, he’s seen the market cap rise from $500 million to $3.5 billion in seven years after he joined the company in 2008.

" As of today, Smilo has opened its private sale!

We have conceptualised a bonus system that will be of real value to you as potential investors. There has also been significant progress in the development of our platform. As such we are now able to present our prototype to trusted investors and venture capitalists, demonstrating the unique benefits of the Smilo Platform to the blockchain society.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/24doga2ysuk11.png

To accommodate our private investors better, we have decided to implement a variable bonus program, which will be defined by the time of entry, the vesting period, and the size of the investment. This variable set-up has been chosen for four major reasons:

* To incentivise early investors
* To reward commitment to our journey for the long term.
* To reward large investments.
* To avoid any tactics which could harm the stability of our platform

This combination will result in a bonus tailored to your specific requirements. On [smilo.io/ico](https://smilo.io/ico) you can find the necessary tools to calculate your specific bonus.

Furthermore, to protect all our investors from any major trading fluctuations, we have decided to gradually release your tokens, spread equally over your selected vesting period. So from the launch of our mainnet to the end of your specific vesting period, we will release a proportionate percentage of your Smilo and SmiloPay each week.

Last but not least, we have decided to use globally recognized SAFT agreements in the private sale process. Moreover, we will execute our public sale upon the launch of our mainnet in Q2 of 2019, and from that point onwards, we will directly release Smilo to the public. The public sale is planned to actively involve our community into our cause and recognize them for their interest in the Smilo Platform.

The maximum cap for the private sale is 13,6 million USD. Once achieved, we will continue with our public sale of 4,4 million USD to reach our targeted total funding of 18 million USD.

If you would like to participate in our private sale, please register [here](https://smilo.io/register/index) and we will provide you with instructions and a tailored SAFT agreement.

"What major players entering the crypto space are trying to do right now: anchor market movements to their actions.

The fact is: the market didn`t dump because of their statement - which, surprise surprise - was just a joke, right friends? ;D
Goldman and alliance were the ones dumping into the market. This was a shake-out before the mark-up. Don't forget, banks are deep into this. They just don't tell you straight because they are not stupid. 

They want to make the herd believe that their will or intentions actually have any influence in this market. The more people believe this, the more power they get, and easier it gets to manipulate the market. For the first time in decades, we have a market where the status quo doesn't have a major advantage on average players. Let us not lose it. 

Don't forget: the power is in our hands. 
Most of us are not top trades and do not have access to cutting edge HFT and A.I. software. If we gamble our tokens away in the market, they accumulate more. If we hodl, they lose.

"Just another warning not to make yourself a target to those who are interested in stealing from you: 

I had my email, Instagram and Bittrex accounts hacked this morning and my Bittrex account was totally drained.

I was following one Crypto news account on Instagram that account led about 5 other Crypto news accounts following me and as far as I can tell I was targeted because of it. My email password was the weak point but I figure they decided to make an attempt at it because of Instagram. They changed all of my Instagram information (name/password/picture) presumably just to fuck with me and I never got any warning because they already had access to my email account and were intercepting the verification emails. The account was changed to have a Russian email address but my Bittrex account appears to have been accessed from somewhere in Amsterdam. 

I should have known better than to have followed them and I double fucked up because I somehow didn't have 2FA set up on Bittrex (I was certain that I did).


They traded everything I had into BTC and then sent it off to this address: 13NEHoWSH4odMWfxfAm8h4ESHE5pdjeWzu. I didn't have a whole lot in there because of the currently shit market (lost about .13 BTC) but this whole situation really sucks regardless.

### Developments in Financial Services

* Apex Clearing, a digital financial clearing and execution company, announced Wednesday of plans to launch a new cryptocurrency brokerage subsidiary. As a result, Apex’s clients, who are primarily wealth management and financial advisory firms, will have access to investment opportunities in cryptocurrencies. Initially in its brokerage service, Apex will include Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and Ethereum before expanding to other coins.   
* The Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) has announced a six-month delay in the rollout of a specialized  blockchain to facilitate equity transactions. ASX has been working to implement the blockchain since December 2017 and had plans to launch in late 2020. However, with the six-month setback, ASX will not launch the blockchain until March or April of 2021. ASX cited plans to devote more time to user development and testing in explaining its decision to delay the blockchain’s launch.   
* Abra, the cryptocurrency wallet startup, is now permitting deposits to come from European bank accounts.  Users in Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) can now transfer Euros (or other national currencies) directly into Abra.  
* The ASX is delaying the roll-out of a blockchain settlement system until 2021.  After receiving 41 written submissions form various stakeholders in the process (clearing &amp; settlement, payment providers, market operators, etc), ASX management decided it makes sense to delay implementation and extend the development testing period.  
* Bittrex announced it is partnering with Cryptrofacil to launch a cryptocurrency trading exchange for Latin America.  The new exchange will be based out of Uruguay.  
* Coinbase announced Thursday of plans to roll out new crypto trading pairs for the British pound. David Farmer, general manager of Coinbase Pro, said in a blog that Coinbase Pro will begin offering trading services for the pound against Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum Classic, and Litecoin. Coinbase Pro already offers trading services for the pound against bitcoin. 
* Crypto.com is launching its first cryptocurrency debit card in Singapore.  The company raised USD$25mm this past June in its an ICO.  Crypto.com will be partnering with payment provider Visa to deliver its debit card.  
* Industrial &amp; Commercial Bank of China, the largest bank in China, has announced it will focus on investing in “intelligent banking” and the deployment of new financial technologies.   The goal of the bank is to introduce “smart banking” to the financial ecosystem in China.  
* ResearchandMarkets.com forecasts that the crypto ATM industry will grow to USD$114.5mm by CY2023 and implies a per annum growth rate of \~54.7%.  The company suggests the majority of the growth will come from two-way ATMs which let customer change digital currency into fiat and vice-versa.  Furthermore, the reported by ResearchandMarkets.com posits that that the majority of the crypto ATMs will be based in North America.   At the moment, crypto ATM industry is forecasted to be \~USD$16.3mm.  
* Robinhood, the mobile zero-fee investment app, revealed Thursday that the firm is actively looking for a CFO while citing ‘definite’ plans for the firm to go public. Robinhood CEO Baiju Bhatt expanded, saying, “it’s definitely on the horizon, not in the immediate term, but that’s something we are thinking about.”  

### Regulatory Environment

* After making a controversial move to hold themselves to know-your-customer (KYC) regulations, ShapeShift exchange is facing criticism from users across the crypto industry. In explaining their decision, CEO Erik Voorhees explained that the idea of requiring customers to hand over private information is something the exchange has struggled with for a long time, but they believe this is the best decision to help the firm navigate the regulatory environment.   
* Breugel, a Belgium-based think tank, argues that the EU should create a single standard for regulating cryptocurrencies for the Euro-bloc.  The group believes there should be common regulations for crypto exchanges and ICOs.  
* Global crypto wallet Abra will begin enabling the direct purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies with European bank accounts, the company announced Tuesday in a press release. Users will now be able to transfer euros and other national currencies into their wallet, which can then be used to purchase any of 28 cryptocurrencies offered by the crypto wallet.   
* The Iranian government has accepted the mining of cryptocurrencies as a formal industry.  The Supreme Cyberspace Council is now focusing on developing a framework for regulation of the crypto mining industry.  
* Members of the European Parliament met Tuesday to review a proposal of regulatory framework that would surround initial coin offerings (ICO). If passed, the proposal would cap token sales of an ICO at EUR 8 million and hold offerings to know-your-customer/anti-money-laundering regulations. The framework would allow projects to raise funds in any of the 28 EU member nations.   
* The Philippines Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said Tuesday that it plans to release trading rules for cryptocurrency exchanges to follow, according to local news outlets. The Philippines has been an early mover in crypto regulation, having already published regulatory framework for initial coin offerings and requiring actual registration of crypto exchanges.  
* A high-ranking official of Ukraine's Finance Ministry, Sergey Verlanov, explained in an interview that Ukrainians are expected to pay the regular 19.5% income tax on profits from crypto related activities. Verlanov went on to add that while cryptocurrencies have no official legal status in Ukraine, they are common items deemed intangible assets.  
* An order issued by Uzbekistan President Shavkat Mirziyoev on Sunday states that Uzbekistan will no longer charge tax on cryptocurrency related income and that licensed cryptocurrency exchanges will not be held to the country’s securities and exchanges regulations. This announcement comes as Uzbekistan is attempting to attract cryptocurrency related businesses to the country.  

### General News

* Andreas Antonopoulos, Bitcoin evangelist, believes Bitcoin ETFs will be negative for Bitcoin long-term as it will let investor speculate about its price more easily.  Antonopoulos believes a Bitcoin ETF will permit market makers to manipulate Bitcoin markets and that individual investors would move away from playing an important part in the decision-making process of the cryptocurrency ecosystem (since they would inevitably shy away from the responsibilities of owning Bitcoin key).  
* Bill Barhydt, CEIO of cryptocurrency payment startup Abra, during an interview on CNBC’s Coin Rush, suggests the SEC is rejecting Bitcoin ETFs because the applicants don’t “fit the mold of who the SEC is used to approving.”  Barhydty suggests a trusted financial organization has better probability of getting a Bitcoin ETF approved than a startup.  
* Bitcoin Depot has launched 20 crypto ATMS in California to bring its total global installed base to 160.  The company expects to reach 200 installed ATMs globally by year-end.  With an install rate of 7 ATM/months, Bitcoin Depot may not reach its management goal of 1,000 installed Bitcoin ATMs by CY2020.  
* Bitcoin’s market capitalization is back to 55% of total digital currency market capitalization, the highest level since December 2017.  
* Bitmain’s AntPool has activated AsicBoost, a controversial method of mining Bitcoin more efficiently.  AsicBoost exploits a previously known weakness in Bitcoin’s proof-of-work algorithm that allows for faster mining. Bitmain notably holds a patent in China for a system that exploits the Bitcoin network’s weakness in order to increase mining productivity.  
* Bitfi, previously advertised as an unhackable Bitcoin wallet, has withdrawn its claim that it is not hackable after cybersecurity researchers were able to discover serious security flaws in Bitfi’s technology.  
* Bittrex has decided to delist Bitcoin Gold following failure by the cryptocurrency to pay Bittrex the monthly listing fee of USD$262,907. 
* Blockchain identity startup Civic has decided to use 333 million of its 1 billion supply of CVC token (\~USD$43mm) to pay for the costs of identity checks of users on its platform as well as stress-testing the protocol.   
* Blockstream VP Warren Togami warned investors on Tuesday of a possible ‘51 percent’ attack on Bitcoin Cash’s blockchain. With a hashrate below 8% of Bitcoin’s , Togami warned that a ‘51 percent attack’ could render the cryptocurrency useless. In his rantings on Twitter, Togami cited Bitcoin Cash’s similarity to Feathercoin, a cryptocurrency who’s ‘51 percent’ attack left the coin obsolete.   
* Cannabis publication, High Times, reported Wednesday that they would be accepting cryptocurrency for its ongoing initial public offering (IPO). High Times initially announced that it would accept bitcoin and Ethereum in the beginning of August; however, it rolled back on its announcement citing regulation issues. Despite the rollback, it appears that bitcoin has remained a payment option in the publication’s IPO.   
* Cryptocurrencies underwent a harsh selloff Wednesday morning with the top 100 coins losing $12 billion of market cap in just one hour. Most notably, Bitcoin’s price dipped below the $7,000 level and Ethereum lost more than 11% in the last 24 hours. CNBC crypto analyst Ran NeuNer cited that a possible reasoning for this price move could be a large sell-off of digital assets from a crypto wallet that may be associated with the infamous Silk Road.

"I'm sick and tired of seeing the idiotic crypto media regurgitating the post made by an idiot a few days ago that didn't know the actual value of USD in Iran. There is a subsidized official exchange rate, which is a fixed rate of 1 USD to 42K IRR. This rate is only used for imports of a certain category of products designated by the government such as food and medicine.

The real value of USD, the one you pay for other products such as bitcoin, is 1 USD to 140K IRR, as of now. Yes it has depreciated significantly within few months (more than 200%), and yes some people buy bitcoin and other cryptocurrency to hedge against such depreciation and yes government legalized mining and the central bank may soon support crypto to IRR exchange as first true adoption of cryptocurrency. But bitcoin value is same as everywhere else when correct exchange rate is used.

"I’m here to share about your ICO team’s need to secure and maximize or protect the value of the raised funds, so your investment will last and grow. 

You see FMF has tiered services and the tokens are encouraged to be used on the platform. A digital asset exchange or an ICO or individual’s access depends on its FMF stake. Basically, the services are for top-notch multisig crypto and fiat custodial services; treasury mgmt with liquidity access to over 95 exchanges for quick and efficient buying and selling digital asset and with an option for P2P lending so extra crypto or cash can earn interest; for payments that has digital fiat withdrawals with full compliance to laws and regulation and/or tru traditional banking with bank partners for international transfers.

So there, simple yet most neglected part of ICO industry – securing and protecting digital assets value. 

You don’t want another bitcoin private story of a developer stealing funds, or an ICO panic selling their ETH, or an ICO that lost the funds through numerous conventions coz the bottom line most affected is YOU- the investor.

"Youtube 'influencers'. Coinbase. Bitcoin futures. Goldman Sachs. Bitcoin ETFs. CNN. All they do all day is track the price of fucking Bitcoin and tell you where it's headed in the next days/months/years and why you should buy or sell. They never talk about other projects and they never talk about the actual tech. They do this for two reasons:

1. ***They're entirely aware that Bitcoin is and will continue to be outclassed in every way by multiple other projects.*** In other words, it has no future. The digital gold narrative is complete bullshit. It takes a freakishly long time and a lot of efforts to overcome solely the mathematical difficulties of building a network that scales well, is secure and operates in a way that is economically sound. Even with a dedicated, qualified, focused team with plenty of resources, it's a tough task. When you look at Bitcoin's governance, it's clear that not only do they not have a focused team, it seems to be actively trying to hinder its development for short-term economic gain. 

2. ***Bitcoin is a gatekeeper to the rest of the market that keeps it completely irrational***, because it has gathered a cult of uneducated and wishful investors who cling to it like their life depends on its future. It makes absolutely *no sense* for a currency to be valued in the hundreds of billions with current levels of adoption, subpar tech and the uncertainty that surrounds it, yet everyone is, 8 months after a prodigious bubble still clinging to the hopes of an ETF while a dozen other teams are progressing by leaps and bounds. Bitcoin is the badge that allows dodgy projects to bloom despite their nonsensical business plans and gives birth to micro-cults who congregate in their echo chambers to rehash talking points about technologies they don't understand.

Where's Wall Street in all this? Simple. This market is a prodigious tool for value extraction. The lack of regulation and volatility combined with how easy it is to manipulate quite simply makes it a predatory financial institution's wet dream. However, everything falls apart if Bitcoin does. Bitcoin keeps the whole show running because it's the living proof that fundamentals don't matter as the the space isn't mature enough to price based on valuation.","Bitcoin will never be widely adopted, because it was never meant to be.

&amp;#x200B;

One great source for me to stay updated with the progress of the TTC Protocol project is the Twitter handle here [https://twitter.com/ttceco](https://twitter.com/ttceco) and the fact I am subscribed to the mailing list as well here [https://www.ttc.eco/ttcprotocol/regisration/](https://www.ttc.eco/ttcprotocol/regisration/) puts me at the top of the ladder of information.  

 In the TTC Protocol Newsletter dialog box click on the preferred language of choice and enter your email then click the submit button, you will get an email notification of your subscription which keeps you informed when there is news. As an avid user of various social media myself this project is relatable to my experience I could understand in clarity what she aim at, going through the several updates including the whitepaper I could clearly understand the need for a decentralized approach to social network and engagements. Apparently global revenue generated from social networks and media is eye opening as well as alarming in terms of revenue generation check out the image of 2013-2019 social media global revenue statistic from [www.statista.com](http://www.statista.com/) below 

 By the end of 2019 social media revenue generation should stand at 39 billion Euros with no plans for its content creators and users who spend their resources and make social media engagement possible besides I am speaking of mainstream social media like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat and the likes. This are centralized social network with centralized servers doing their very best to creating the environment for social interactions but aren’t exactly making the users feel appreciated or secured. The bulk of the flaws of centralized systems are that of security, harmful exposure of user data and lack of control, the better alternative is to go the way of decentralization. If you are not in the know already decentralization is the process by which the activities of an organization in this case social network are distributed or delegated away from a central, authoritative location or group. The technology behind the TTC protocol engine is the Blockchain which made the concept of decentralization popular and commonplace as well owing to its disruptive built and adventurous aims. “The decentralized nature of Blockchain technology means that it doesn’t rely on a central point of control. A lack of a single authority makes the system fairer and considerably more secure” –Lisk.io   

User information on the Blockchain is way more protected than in an centralized system. There have been great shift in recent times from centralization to decentralization owing to the many advantages the later possess against the former. But in a decentralized platform like the TATAUfo the advantages of decentralization are enormous.

"**CEO FORTnightly Message - 07/09/18**

Since I wrote to you last, we have witnessed significant volatility in the markets and, with it, some voices of concerns about where the token industry is heading.  We ignore the naysayers and, regardless of market conditions, look to the future with increasing confidence. There are a number of reasons why, that I‘d like to share with you.
 
The demand for higher standards is now greater than ever before and comes from every corner: governments, regulators, industry, and general consumers. As a result standards, accountability and transparency are improving.  There is of course still work to do on a global level but players such as GBX, in supportive jurisdictions like Gibraltar, continue to take bold steps to help move the industry forward, to increase confidence. The GBX-GRID (token sale platform) and our GBX-DAX (Digital Asset Exchange) are venues where today token issuers, buyers, and sellers can go and be treated honestly and fairly.
 
Furthermore, the emergence of security tokens (securities issued in token form onto blockchains) are the beginning of the next evolutionary step for our industry: to create new products, new markets, widen participation and liquidity, enhance the delivery of service in capital markets, and improve the risk profile of the market’s infrastructure.
 
From our meetings with many people in the industry, including more recently at conferences in London and Singapore, we believe that many are overwhelmed with information on this subject but at the same time, hungry for knowledge and eager for a regulatory compliant solution.
 
Just as we are doing for utility tokens, we at GBX are playing a significant role in providing global leadership on security tokens within the GSX Group. Providing clarity, consistency and certainty on this matter is truly one of the main themes to watch out for now and into 2019. We are eager to share with you our plans soon and we wish for all our ROCKers to join us on this important step in our journey.

In the meantime I have some fantastic updates to share, including some great upcoming announcements, so let's get to it ROCKers!  

**Welcoming CCMC to the Sponsor Firm Network**

Our global network continues to grow, strengthening our offering for the GBX. Their experience as blockchain venture capital investors brings additional strength to the network.  It’s a pleasure to welcome Martin and the CMCC team to the GBX.

"*It’s a like a Hollywood movie. A  shadowy figure works out out how to plunder a huge hoard of cash hidden  away years ago by person or persons unknown, somehow connected to the  criminal underworld. The money moves but no one knows who’s doing it –  only that something big is happening, and that there are machinations  going on far behind the scenes that most of us will never understand.*

Thousands of bitcoins sat in numerous  accounts that have been dormant since 2014 have started moving. The  original address and the activity connected to it have been the topic of  an extensive investigation by [reddit user sick\_silk](https://www.reddit.com/user/sick_silk). The total value of those accounts, including BCH and other fork coins, approaches a billion dollars.

In one post he discusses the [origins of the BTC](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9bfnff/near_1b_are_currently_on_the_move_from_a_silkroad/); in another, he shows that [large amounts – around $100 million – have just been moved to Binance and Bitfinex](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9ceb5v/1b_bitcoins_on_the_move_owner_transfers_100m_to/) – suggesting they will be sold for alts and USD respectively.

From the analysis, it seems that the  bitcoins ultimately come from a Silk Road address – the famous dark  market that sold drugs and other illegal items for BTC, and that was  shut down by the FBI in 2013. It appears that the coins were ‘tumbled’  back in 2014, and split among many different addresses. However, it was  still possible to link them back to the original account, which was set  up in 2011, with a transfer associated with Ross Ulbricht: the ‘Dread  Pirate Roberts’ who founded the Silk Road.

Nowadays, the digital asset market has been encountering many problems, including its susceptibility to market volatility and price fluctuations as well as its lack of security and transparency. To address these problems, the DAEX project builds a distributed digital asset clearing ecosystem based on blockchain technology - a secure trusted and open network in which everyone can witness value.The DAEX ecosystem will decouple assets and transactions, enable token-based authentication and restructure the transaction process. This will allow for safer and more efficient distributed registration, clearing and settlement of digital assets. Using this as a foundation, DAEX will serve the entire digital asset market, from digital asset exchanges comprising of multiple interconnected nodes to individual digital asset users.

## What are the advantages of DAEX ecosystem?

The DAEX ecosystem provides the following advantages to participants in the system:

**- Secure:** Thanks to a built-in, smart-contract-based privacy protection protocol which uses chain identification codes, DAEX ecosystem guarantees the objectivity of the clearing process and protect the safety of customers’ assets. User’s assets are all held on the blockchain and cannot be moved without user’s admission.

**- Trusted:** After each completed digital asset transaction, the DAEX clearing and settlement process will ensure that the changes in data are synchronized between all nodes concurrently; therefore providing a reliable environment for exchanges and traders. The blockchain technology guarantees the authenticity of the settlement prices, which are based on composite prices of the underlying asset of participating exchanges.

**- Open:** The DAEX ecosystem is open to new exchanges. This means exchanges that participate in the DAEX ecosystem can utilize all products and services provided by DAEX, such as wallets and clearing. In addition, exchanges can expect to use more value-added services provided byDAEX in the future, including cryptocurrency derivatives trading.

**- More Robust:** With the multiple-part private key, the DAEX ecosystem prevents users from privately keeping and transmitting a complete key. By putting the user at the centre of the process and using a consensus mechanism, it also makes accounting on the distributed ledger more efficient.

**- A Richer User Experience:** The DAEX solution also increases the scalability of the blockchain, enabling fast transactions of multiple assets. At the same time, the basic high-level services of the Clearing Chain can retain the same transaction depth while offering an abundant business ecosystem for derivatives and digital assets.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/gtqbq26r3sk11.png

## Finding out what benefits our society can get from DAEX Tokens

Despite being still in its very early stage, the cryptocurrencies industry has a strong growth potential. The goal of DAEX is to help the industry grow in a more orderly and secure way by providing a solid infrastructure that benefits many industry players.

DAEX provides CaaS (Clearing as a Service) for the cryptocurrency trading industry. Since the operation of this CaaS is objective and transparent, it is an effective infrastructure service to the whole industry. By using this service, the industry becomes unbiased, objective and transparent so that industry resources become more effectively used.

Moreover, as a clearing service, the DAEX Tokens can also provide a more effective way to list digital assets. With the booming of ICO events, selecting quality coins to list and make related business and technology work ready become a very burdensome work for many exchanges. Users can simplify exchange jobs with DAEX wallets. With that, exchanges can be made quickly with the services of DAEX, thereby creating competition in the crypto industry.

DAEX ecosystem offers participating exchanges some new competitive advantages over competitors. Firstly, the token rewarding mechanism for everyone-clearing will attract more new users and generate more trading quantity. Secondly, the DAEX multi-asset wallet minimizes the delivering cost and helps users have full autonomy over digital assets in his wallets. Thirdly, the separation of trading and clearing helps exchanges to focus more on their core competencies, thus maintain their competitive advantages.

## In conclusion

DAEX solution brings about many advantages for any player in the cryptocurrency industry. This distributed ledger technology-based system assists digital asset users not only in lowering transaction costs an accelerating transaction speed but also increasing security and transparency level. Generally, it effectively removes trader’s asset risks in currently centralized exchanges.

 Jun Ho Lee has become the CEO of JIENUM a platform that provides lodge-booking services for travellers while he was majoring Economics at Northwestern University. Jun Ho felt that there were a lot of apps for booking hotel rooms, but younger tourists still were not well-informed about various unique lodging options such as guest houses. He wanted to create a platform to introduce many suitable choices for travellers. Based on more than 1,000 guest home vacation spots in South Korea, Jienem is introducing all of its businesses such as MonStay, EGStay guesthouse franchise, business establishment education, and consignment operations. Among the Korean O2O (online to offline) guesthouses, the only place where the online reservation service and the offline guest house are operated together is Jienem. A giant accommodation reservtation service operator Yanolja made a strategic investment in Jienem company. Jienem also attracted investments from Capston Partners for free series A which is worth $500 million (500 million KRW). This investment is meaningful because VC's investment in startup companies is highly valued and driven by its future growth. Jun Ho was a part of Gookmin University’s entrepreneurship group’s idea that got selected as a part of Korea’s sponsored accelerated program. He has been able to get funding from Angel Investment and OnChina, a Chinese Marketing company. He obtained a valuable work experience from Internship at Nics Co., Ltd, Buk Co., Ltd, JW Pharmaceutical Corporation Intern and Korea Investment &amp; Securities.

"Hey guys, i want to give you my input on the current market and i think everybody here will find some value into what im saying. So as we knew last year, people were making money on the upside but now this year since the market had turn bearish, people found a way to make money on the down side. So now what you see are all these former ‘hodlers’ of last year are now ‘traders’ all of a sudden trying to time bitcoin on bitmex. And from what you seen this year, all these good projects had to suffer because of what bitcoin is doing. This turned these hodlers into traders, dumping their alts to bet against bitcoin. On the whale’s mind or whoever is playing the strings, i think they used their manipulation on bitcoin this year with your touch of fud articles to drive the rest of the market down because they know the alts will drive the next bull run. So now that alt prices are super lower, these btc whales are unloading to your favorite altcoins while all the new wannabe traders are too busy trying to time bitcoin. Long story short, now that bitcoin’s price is obviously manipulated and people are starting to wake up, i think what you’ll see soon is everybody trying to FOMO into alts while the new ‘traders’ calling your bags shitcoins will be left in the dust.

"Hi crypto fans,
I am a 20 year old student who has been following crypto for about a year. Learning about bitcoin has been a life changer. To me a life where bitcoin replaces fiat is a world that I would love to be a part of. For this reason and because of my believe in Satoshi’s ideas, I started accumulating bitcoin. Unfortunately right when I started was on the bounce close to 10k. Almost the entire time I have been accumulating I have been losing money. This has been a blessing in disguise. Over this spring and summer I have been putting all my hard earned cash into crypto. Today I have finally accumulated about 1 BTC. I am not worried about the price in the near term, but am optimistic. I will never sell even if we drop to close to zero. There are only ever going to be 21 million bitcoins. My hope is my family holds after my death. Thanks for reading guys and good luck in the coming years! HODL",No one to tell... so here I am,CryptoCurrency,0

"All this talk of ""bull runs"" about to occur is pie in the sky. The last bull run occurred when there was a somewhat sudden craze similar to Pokemon in the late 90's last year. Where normal people in society started to FOMO and bought told their friends to do the same and Coinbase saw huge growth along with Google 'bitcoin' searches at an all time high. Most of these normal people who jumped on the easy money gravy train / band wagon sold when they lost 90% of their portfolio and don't want nothing to do with cryptocurrency at the moment. The whales/banks/government/illuminati/michael jackson who are 'manipulating' the market are not going to 'pump' any coins until normal people start using crypto, and while there is Fear, Uncertainty &amp; Doubt bull runs are not going to occur. So what do I think will cause the next Bull run... Adoption. Once some of these products have real working use cases and normal people start using this technology and understanding it more there will be market cap increases that come with it. In my opinion Vechain has the best chance right now at seeing real world use cases. People often speak about Venezeula and how there could be real world use case for Bitcoin /Nano due tothe inflation problem. However I was on the ground there in Caracas a few months ago and a major problem with this is that the USD is the unofficial currency.

Who likes this idea? It seems like it would be fun considering the max anyone can lose is $25 which will not hurt too bad but the reward potential would be enormous. I would even limit monthly amounts anyone can trade because I do believe people should be careful leverage trading crypto.

We will see more and more manipulated market the more those banksters crooks gets near the crypto. Idiots are happy about BAKKT, but forgets that the same company was responsible for silver price manipulation.

People somehow waiting for tools those crooks are making, trading desks, exchanges. They make those things just to profit from you. They would be able to see shorts, longs, stop loss possitions and bet AGAINST people who using their platform! This is done for decades now.

**Bitcoin can not be stopped-popular fairy tale** \-  It can and very easy. Gov can print whatever amount of currency they want. Gov can overtake mining farms and so on. SO lets say gov builds mining center and gets 51% of BTC hashing power. THen rejects all the transactions. People would make hard fork for new BTC - gov will switch t new blockchain and get 51% hashing power and rejects again transactions. The problem with current system is -it depends on money, who have more money - have more control.  SO gov, banks will always win.

The only possible blockchain system that i see can survive would be the one, that is ""mined"" while people using phones, browsing internet.. doing daily stuff. SO almost all population could become ""miners"".  Best would be special routers that confirms tx, that require no hard calculations to waste energy, but just to proof transaction. Bitcoin and all PoW coins is flawed and can be stopped.

**Regarding Technical Analysis** \- TA DO NOT WORK! **TA is called herd mentality**.  While in previous years people bought btc for other then profit reasons, movement of prices was big, sometimes looked like random.  Now everybody listens to some idiot on youtube, twitter who say 7700$ is major resistance!  5800$ is major support.. SO what happens? Many idiots thinks it's true so makes trades based on those numbers. And more people doing the same then those who trade based on emotions and so on. SO price starts to move just like TA ""predicted"". It's not that TA works, is just people to dumb to think, and follows nonsense and makes nonsese to be reality. We do not have bullrun because EVERYBODY thinks that we will go more down, that crypto have some stupid support or resistances. No it DOESNT! People have. And that's why it kills bullrun.

"Today I received a random outbound transaction on my ERC20 wallet.  I got the notification from Etherscan that I just sent tokens and freaked out that my private keys got compromised.  After doing some digging and following the breadcrumbs from the name of the token I apparently sent, I found out that this outbound transaction of some random token from my wallet was actually an access token to KYC on a new project's ICO/DEX/whatever the heck they're doing KYC for -- I'm not really sure.  

So what is actually going on in this transaction is something that's new to Solidity apparently.  The devs of this new project did this as a way of garnering some attention and showing off that they have found some new functions and features of both Solidity and the Ethereum blockchain (maybe other blockchains too).  I was freaked out at first but then I realized that there's still new and inventive things being discovered and that we haven't hit a roadblock in blockchain development.  I'm not going to mention the name of the company because I don't want to make this into an ad for them, but if you or anyone else you know has either received a token today or sent a token today in your ERC20 wallet that is literally nowhere to be found, you can track them down.  Feel free to PM me if you want to know.

"In the music industry if an artist is appropriately empowered and compensated for his past endeavours he will accomplish more. So if an artist isn't appropriately remunerated there are chances he may pass up a major opportunity.
To ensure adequate compliance with artists rewards and rights led to the creation of a dual token ecosystem known as CYFM (from CyberFM) and MFTU ( from Mainstream For The Underground) token ecosystem.

"Change my view!

PoW currencies rely on the fact that it takes 51% of the computing power of a network to redo the network's transaction history. Schemes to add more blockchains to the network in an attempt to scale up throughput fracture the amount of computing power necessary to attack any individual blockchain and double spend. 

Without multiple blockchains, PoW currencies can't support asynchronous transactions and can't significantly scale any further. Yes, multiple transactions are being processed in each block, but at the end of the day the network has to wait to collect transactions to synchronize itself, instead of being able to process unrelated transactions (eg, A -&gt; B and C -&gt; D) immediately and in parallel. Increasing block size doesn't work either due to bandwidth capacity constraints, and either way, individual transactions will still take the time between block creation (10 minutes) plus however many iterations of block creations you need to wait to feel secure that the transaction is finalized.

"You may know that I’m big supporter of Ignite Ratings, it’s no secret. However, I have to admit that when Damon and Chris said how this ICO rating market is corrupted I think they were over exaggerating. I mean, I knew there was an issue, that’s why I love what’s ignite trying to do but I honestly didn’t believe it was that big of an issue.


With the recent update to the Ignite Ratings beta platform, I decided to start building up my reputation by reviewing one ICO/crypto each day (which is really hard btw because not many people are willing to review my work :P ). I started by doing my own research based on reading whitepapers and googling some things up. As you could expect, the amount of shitty ICOs is overwhelming and I decided to check out what other “reputable” sources have to say about them. And it wasn’t pretty.


Today I reviewed iCasting.io, basically a Tinder for matching talented people with clients. On a blockchain. Perhaps a good idea but there is absolutely no need for the blockchain tech in it. Close to 0 token utility plus some other budgeting decisions make it an obvious cash grab.


What does icobench has to say? 4.1 overall score, “experts” praising this with lame statements such as as “strong team, great advisory board, bold vision etc”. THIS IS SCARY. Out of 11 reviews, only two where honest and authors were immediately discredited and downvoted. But take a look yourself: https://icobench.com/ico/icasting-io/ratings#ratings

"CryptoCurrency market in 2017 had a significant growth, many cryptocurrencies grew by thousands of percent (%) and there will be a greater market growth in years to come due to increased adoption.

 For a transaction to take place, it must be validated and new blocks must be generated into the chain by miners. Proof-of-Work (PoW) is the first consensus used by early cryptocurrency networks such as Bitcoin, Ethereum; also the alternative way of transaction validation came into place known as Proof-of-Stake (PoS) algorithm. However, both consensus has two main disadvantages of low transaction speed and high transaction cost. As the number of network participants grow, the number of transactions waiting for validation increases too. 

This shows that these algorithms of consensus are not scalable enough to process the transactions in time, hence, traders often incur losses since they work with high volatile cryptocurrency market.

Which of the algorithm do you think is best for cashbery coin to operate on since they are poised to be a transferring resource dt will be ideal for both customers and businesses?

"Cointelegraph just put out an article in the middle of the night EST time (as they always do even though they are a U.S. company) which had ""SEC denied Bitcoin ETF's"" in the title. That wasn't the whole title and was not even the point of the article but they made sure to put that in their so that people's bots would read the headline and dump their BTC accordingly without stopping the process based on a better, human interpretation of the title of the article. It worked perfectly considering that giant red 15 minute candle happened right after the article was put out. The whole title is ""Abra CEO: SEC Denies Bitcoin ETFs Because Applicants Do Not Fit Industry Archetype"" and Cointelegraph obviously did this on purpose because there is a million other ways to name that article that don't have those FUD keywords. I really don't like Cointelegraph. I'm not a big time trader with bots and webscrapers picking up on Bitcoin articles and SEC tweets but I am hoping that this will be short lived since it isn't even real FUD.

SwissBorg Toronto team's Marco Guerriero and Ankit Mittal have developed the very first SwissBorg Crypto Indices. The SB Top20 and the SB Next30 are the first of the crypto lists that have been developed by SwissBorg to track cryptos tailored to individual investment tastes and preferences. With the indices, SwissBorg aims to give our community members a taste of what is to come with our investment app. The indices are customised menus or basket of cryptos that an individual would acquire together. 

The SwissBorg Top 20 Index tracks the performance of the Top20 Crypto assets weighted by market capitalization and capped at 20% per component. USD Tether and any other stablecoins are excluded from the calculation. The weights are re-calculated and adjusted every 20 days. The index starts on January 1st, 2016 at a value of 434.33$, which was the price of BTC USD on that date. This index provides a 2.5-year track record for investors to study. 

The [SwissBorg](https://swissborg.com/en/) Next30 Index is representative of smaller capitalization Crypto assets. It tracks the performance of the Top 30 Cryptos after the Top 20, weighted by market capitalization and capped at 5% per component. USD Tether and any other stablecoins are excluded from the calculation. The weights are re-calculated and adjusted every 20 days. The index starts on January 1st, 2017 at a value of 998.33, which was the price of BTC USD on that date providing a more than one-year track record for investors. 

Right now SwissBorg’s two indices plus BTC and Top20 are live on our website and can be consulted to track crypto assets. We aim to produce more indices that cater to different tastes for investment strategies. The motivation behind this soft launch is to introduce our community to what to expect in our investment app. These teasers for our investment app, are buckets of crypto assets picked by SwissBorg. Community members can go to the indices page on our website to consult and track; they will find listed the percentage of market percentages in which ratio they’d want to invest their crypto assets. The SwissBorg crypto asset indices will allow the user to diversify their investment. Enthusiasts can use our interactive charts to explore data covering over two years of each of the indices related to BTC and examine individual indices.  

[r/swissborg](https://www.reddit.com/r/swissborg/) is proud and delighted to take this pioneering step towards fulfilling our goal of building a wealth management ecosystem that aims to demystify and make accessible the world of cryptos for our community members and the world at large!

"[My website](https://crowdsound.net/lyrics) ([https://crowdsound.net/lyrics](https://crowdsound.net/lyrics)) is generating a song (melody and lyrics) from the microvotes of over 100,000 participants (writers).

In order to encourage more participation, I am considering creating a cryptocurrency to help motivate people to participate more.  These are my ideas so far:

* People would receive (mine) a new ""crowdsoundcoin"" every time they vote.
* Artists who make money from the song would then be encouraged to donate to the ""writers"".
* Proceeds from the donations would then be dispersed (as new crowdsoundcoins) in proportion to how many crowdsoundcoins that person owns.

So this would allow the writers to also be stakeholders in the song itself.

I am interested to hear your thoughts about this idea?

2. Would a coin like this be easy to set up?  If so, which coin should I base this on?  Ethereum?

"[Liquid is a new cryptocurrency platform](https://www.liquid.com/) from Quoine that brings everything together under one roof: 

* **Enhanced liquidity**
* **Top security with cold wallet storage**
* **Multiple fiat pairs (USD, JPY, SGD, AUD, EUR)**
* **Intuitive UI and focus on user experience**
* **JFSA licensed, Big 4 audited**
* **All-in-one ICO platform**
* **No trading fees for crypto-fiat** 
* **Margin trading** 
* **Lending**
* **24/7 support** 
* **Robust KYC/AML** 
* **QASH utility token benefits**



#Liquidity

The lack of liquidity in cryptocurrency is a major problem. Our tech, the World Book, allows trades from different trading pairs to be matched, combining orders on Liquid into one currency-agnostic order book, which our users view in their currency of choice, while FX conversion happens under the bonnet to give all markets the liquidity they deserve.

Right now, the World Book is live for BTC, ETH, and BCH against fiat pairs. In time, this will be expanded to all cryptocurrencies and pairs on Liquid. 

But the liquidity doesn’t stop flowing there. We will expand the World Book and connect it to a global network of exchanges, creating a deep liquidity pool.


[Watch this video to see how our the World Book affects trading spreads in a massive way.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q68zB0Xj9nw) 

#The user experience 

Our whole platform is designed for the beginner, and built for the expert. We have listened to our customers and traders from around the world to help us identify what’s most important to them. It was important for us understand our audience along with their hopes, frustrations and aspirations. 

We have worked hard to ensure that our platform is an ideal gateway for new users, while we also offer sophisticated trading tools so experienced traders can do what they do best. You can see this in effect in our trading dashboard and, in particular, in the attention we have given to the margin trading experience. 

#A safe haven for token sales

Investing in ICOs can suck. There are so many things that can go wrong, so we created our own ICO hosting platform, which is great for investors and token issuers. 

You can invest in ICOs in a range of currencies in just a few simple clicks. You only have to provide KYC once to have access to all public sales on Liquid. All ICOs hosted on Liquid are thoroughly vetted. 

For token issuers, hosting through our ICO platform is great because you don’t have to worry about any of the token sale process. We take care of you at every step.

#QASH - our utility token

QASH, soon to be known as the Liquid Token, is the utility token on our platform. Using QASH provides our users with exclusive benefits on Liquid, such as:

* 50% trading fee discount 
* ICO participation benefits and bonuses if paying with QASH
* QASH holders can be eligible for airdrops 
* Trading rebate 
* Voting rights 
* Exclusive campaigns and events

QASH will be the lifeblood of Liquid. If you are interested in reading about the utility of the token in more detail, please read our blog about the utility.  

#Security

Security is everything in cryptocurrency. We have various processes in place that ensure your fund safety, mainly our cold storage and Iron Shield security protocols. 

Iron Shield is our user protection system that puts your account into cooldown if you change a security aspect of you account - password, email, 2fa. When in cooldown, you cannot change any of the other security aspects of the account. This makes it extremely unlikely a hacker can take over our users accounts. 



#Compliant

Liquid is focused on being regulation friendly. We wanted to build an exchange our customers can trust. We believe that regulation is the way forward in this industry. We want to follow the rules but push the boundaries. This is the best way for cryptocurrency to grow and for our users to be safe.

You can even choose your local Fiat currency and get live conversion rates for any country.

https://i.redd.it/ts3717egfkk11.png

&amp;#x200B;

No need to record details of every trade. Just keep track of your crypto purhcases (from fiat) and what coins you currently hold. The spreadsheet will calculate the rest and keep a record of how your portfolio and holdings have changed over time.

https://i.redd.it/zeon8s8xfkk11.png

This data gets saved every time you save the spreadsheet.

I find this very handy to see if your trading is actually profitable compared to the HODL method.

Oh yes and there are plenty of 'moon math' and analytics to see how bitcoin is trending and how far off you are from a lambo. This includes a full history of bitcoins price which updates every time you open the sheeet.

wanted to share this with you: https://www.ibm.com/blockchain

IBM is pushing heavy on their Blockchain tech (Germany here), ads running everywhere with usable solutions for Business. I was interested and went to look at it how they implemented it.

This is their main partner: https://www.hyperledger.org/

IBM is not hiding it, they talk on the solutions they have together with Hyperledger and for what those solutions can be used. And no, there is no token. The main usages advertised are: Food safety, Private equity &amp; Trusted identity with many possible fields hinted at.

As I see it, they have finished the integration of blockchain tech in their business solution portfolio. You dont get more adoption that this. 

I know many will not like how this look, with the usual shit-talk in comments, but remember, the customer decides which products they use, and this seems to be the solution which they want and use.  No Moon and Lambo guys.

So someone correct me if I'm wrong but some whale moves 100k plus bitcoins into over a 1000 different wallets and then moves 100 million dollars worth to a couple exchanges and that causes bitcoin to drop almost 500 bucks and takes down all Altcoins with it too. Am I the only one who is not cool with this?  I'm sorry but a system built around glass see through wallets has failed all of us today.  Look man I have no problem with people who have enough money to feed Ethiopia for a hundred years. Good for them. I just don't want to lose my ass every time one of these whales wants to move some funds around and causes a world wide panic selloff. This garbage just proves that transparancy projects like bitcoin will never be accepted by mainstream. It's time for the crypto world to embrace privacy coins so the next time a whale wants to move a billion dollars worth of crypto around it does not ruin everyone else day. ,Bitcoin has made chumps out of us today,CryptoCurrency,0

I think this is just one of many examples that **crypto is already basically everywhere**, from finance to gambling, from academia to sports, from North America to Africa. People are getting used to it, it’s all over the news and it’s not a geeky mystery anymore.
