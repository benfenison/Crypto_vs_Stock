"Hello,

I was banned last week from /ripple for pointing this out.  

There is currently ~39.5 billion XRP in circulation.

Out of that 39.5 billion XRP almost half of that is owned by a small handful of individuals that helped start Ripple.

Jeb McCaleb owns ~9 billion, almost 25% of the circulating supply.  He has an agreement in place that keeps him from selling a small minute amount each month.  It's important to note that at year 5 and 6 he is allowed to sell 1 billion and 2 billion XRP per year (Hello price crash).

Chris Larsen owns ~5.2 billion.

The next part gets shaky and I'll be the first to admit but even if the following individuals own a negligible amount, it should be noted that between McCaleb and Larsen own ~35% of the total supply of XRP.

Brad Garlinghouse the CEO of Ripple is said to own a substantial amount. Enough to vault him to 54th place on Forbes billionaire list.  I have no idea what this would equate to in XRP holdings but it HAS to be a substantial amount.  

The next are the other founders of XRP, we have no idea how much XRP these guys own.

- Arthur Britto
- David Schwartz 
- Ryan Fugger

It's very important to note we have NO IDEA how much XRP that Garlinghouse, Britto, Schwartz, or Fugger own cumulatively.

Without even taking what those four individuals into consideration the total amount of circulating XRP owned by past and present Ripple employees stands at 35 % of total circulating supply PLUS what those four individuals own.

What is decentralization?

Decentralization - the dispersion of distribution of functions and powers.

Garlinghouse and Schwartz have recently argued that XRP is decentralized.  I'd agree that the XRP network in itself is decentralized but when a small number of individuals are wielding the majority of the supply, than the power of that coin is not decentralized. 

What happens when Jeb McCaleb is able to sell his billions of XRP in a single year, hello sell wall.

For that matter, what happens when any of the above individuals decide to sell their XRP at the same time?

I'd also like to note, and this is well known in the XRP community, that the price of XRP remains 'mysteriously' stable at times.  Even now, the rest of the market shifts and XRP stays the same price.  It's been like that for as long as I've held the token.

So I'll let the community be the judge as I am censored from /ripple.  

A small handful of individuals owning what could amount to at best 35% of a coins total supply (at worse it could be well over 50% of the total supply) equate to a decentralized digital asset?

"Quant Company,  
Product: Overledger , Quant Health , GoVerify  
Team of CEO's: Gilbert Verdian , Paolo Tasca , Colin Paterson. (Rest of team: [https://www.quant.network/team/](https://www.quant.network/team/))  
This month (confirmed): SDK Release, Rebranding (Website, new video's , new foto's) , Token Burn  
This month(Estimated): 5 New exchanges, 100 FTSE/Fortune 500 company's. (which are confirmed and signed, only planning on releasing press statement)

Overledger:  
Overledger is the blockchain operating system that enables interoperability between blockchains and connects the world’s existing networks and the Internet to blockchain.

Overledger encourages innovation by allowing developers to build applications across multiple ledgers or multi-chain applications (MApps), meaning that developers can harness the power of multiple individual blockchains to build the most effective solution instead of being confined to just one (‘single-ledger dependency’). Overledger not only enables blockchain-to-blockchain communication, it also takes things a step further and seamlessly connects existing networks and the Internet to blockchain, allowing Enterprises to harness the power of blockchain to address real-world challenges.

Overledger is already connect to: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and Hyperledger network. Of course way more to come.

This means a ledger, app (mapp) , company or any IoT device can be deployed, connected and function on every chain and real world internet as we know it today.

Quant Health: More info to come with new website. (this month's rebranding) They already had meetings with for example the department of Health (London) and more.

GoVerify: GoVerify is a new system to verify if a caller, texter or emailer is the legit person behind this. They already are deploying this on banks and there is a huge demand for it. Trusttag so to call.

Partners: As stated, We have more than one fortune 500/FTSE 100 company signed. We are going to the press release cycle now. They work with Governments, Lloyd's bank and China's ministry of Commerce and more governments.  
Also if seen here under Gilbert Verdian has a patented ISO Standard were 44 governments work with.

* *Quant Network and the JBI have signed a MoU for a five-year cooperation.*
* *Overledger is the only platform to facilitate internet-scale development and deployment of decentralised, multi-chain applications (MApps) and Treaty Contracts (multi-chain smart contracts)*

Gilbert Verdian:  
""Gilbert is a technologist with an upbringing in business and a deep background in technology and security.

Having over 20 years of industry experience he has worked across Government in Downing St, HM Treasury, Cabinet Office, Ministry of Justice and NSW Health and private sector at CSC, EY, HSBC and BP.

Having a keen interest in disruptive technology, he’s the founder of the Blockchain ISO Standard TC307 and is the Chair of the UK’s national committee on Blockchain and Distributed Ledger technologies (DLT/1).

He’s actively working to advance technology in the areas of AI, Cybersecurity, Blockchain and FinTech.""

Paolo Tasca:

""Paolo Tasca is a Digital Economist, an expert on digital innovation with salient expertise on Blockchain technologies and Complex Systems.

We stand on the brink of a fourth industrial revolution, which will fundamentally alter the way we live, work, and relate to one another. New technologies are dramatically transforming our economic systems, and our society in general, into something very different from what we were used to thinking about over the last few decades.""

Colin Paterson:  
""Colin is a technology innovator with a background in Information, Cybersecurity and AI.

He calls on his years of cross sector experience in; Health, Defence, Finance and Utilities combined with his passion for new and emergent technologies to solve real world problems.  
Working to democratise blockchain development he is seeking along with the other founders of Quant to help developers unchain the full potential of ledger technologies.""

The team has connections over the whole world, aiming to be the most enterprise experienced team in the crypto space. They have spoken with many company's like PwC and such. On the telegram you can find much more answers of them, and they are very active (outside the Telegram). Every monday the team joins telegram to answer all questions. (AMA)

"After noticing that Bitcoin kind of bottomed out at ~5000 euros I finally decided it was time to buy more. I made a transfer from my bank to my Coinbase account and, before the money arrived, surely enough, Bitcoin started rising consistently again. I decided I’d wait for the next dip to make the purchase. 

So now when the price is rising I am happy because of the coins I already have, and if the price drops I will be happy that I can buy again at a “low price”.

"We saw how in 2017 USDT pumped market cap by issuing new tokens, which lead to more fiat money entering into the crypto market. 

&amp;#x200B;

A token that is not volatile on the most volatile market in the world was born in 2015, approximately 7 years after BTC. In June 2015, Tether issued around six mln tokens. Tether’s behavior led to BTC market cap increasing by 5 mln in a month, which at the time was a serious increase.

&amp;#x200B;

During 2015 - 2017, Tether issued more asset-backed tokens pledged to USD. BTC market cap was increasing as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

Market got tripped up because of the human greed. 

At the beginning of the 2017 ICO(scam) boom started, a lot of scammers siphoned billions out of our world of the digital economy. 

They bought Lambos, yachts, huge flats, etc. 

They thought that nothing would happen to them. But the big brother is watching you boys, and it is the decentralised community. There’s nowhere to run. 

&amp;#x200B;

Nowadays, I think that asset-backed tokens could move a lot more fiat money into the market, which will lead to The Big Bang Bull run. 

&amp;#x200B;

There are a lot of asset classes, that might be tokenised. 

Do you have any asset-backed tokens in your portfolio? 

Could you share your experience of acquiring asset-backed tokens, did you purchase them during the ICO or you used the exchanges?

Which of them do you prefer?",Another Big Bang Theory,CryptoCurrency

* The Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) has announced a six-month delay in the rollout of a specialized  blockchain to facilitate equity transactions. ASX has been working to implement the blockchain since December 2017 and had plans to launch in late 2020. However, with the six-month setback, ASX will not launch the blockchain until March or April of 2021. ASX cited plans to devote more time to user development and testing in explaining its decision to delay the blockchain’s launch.  
* Bitcoin has maintained a price level above US$7,200 for the three days, displaying a level of stability investors have not seen since early 2017. After breaking through the US$7,200 price level, analysts believe a move past US$7,500 is next.  
* Blockstream VP Warren Togami warned investors on Tuesday of a possible ‘51 percent’ attack on Bitcoin Cash’s blockchain. With a hashrate below 8% of Bitcoin’s , Togami warned that a ‘51 percent attack’ could render the cryptocurrency useless. In his rantings on Twitter, Togami cited Bitcoin Cash’s similarity to Feathercoin, a cryptocurrency who’s ‘51 percent’ attack left the coin obsolete.  
* The Chairman of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) announced the bank’s intention to focus on blockchain technology development, as reported by BiaNews on September 1. With more than 5,000 corporate and 530 million personal customers, ICBC is the largest bank in China. ICBC Chairman Yi Huiman clarified that the financial institution will focus on improvements in cloud computing, big data, Internet of Things and artificial intelligence 
* German exchange Deutsche Börse announced Tuesday that they have launched a new unit dedicated to cryptocurrency and blockchain development.

Users will now be able to transfer euros and other national currencies into their wallet, which can then be used to purchase any of 28 cryptocurrencies offered by the crypto wallet.  
* Japanese city Tsukuba has officially become the first Japanese city to test a voting system that leverages blockchain technology. The blockchain voting system allows citizens to vote on different social contribution project proposals, such as the construction of a cheap sporting facility and the creation of a new cancer diagnostics center.  
* The Korea Internet and Security Agency (KISA) reported Tuesday that it plans to spend at least US$9 million on blockchain project next year. KISA has so far spent US$3.8 million on blockchain projects this year, meaning a US$9 million 2019 budget would approximately double its budge. KISA said that this budget would be spent in both the public and private sector.  
* The price of Monero (XMR) surged over 20% this week after Satis Group, an ICO advisory firm, published a report containing bulling forecasts for the coin. The report details a 38,391% upside over the next ten years, citing the case for a need of anonymous cryptocurrency projects like Monero.  
* The People’s Bank of China announced Tuesday that it has officially launched the testing phase of its blockchain trade finance platform, according to the Shanghai Securities News. The new blockchain aims to provide an “open financial and trade ecosystem based on the Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macau Bay are.” The new blockchain should help banks conduct business authenticity audits, slash business costs, and improve efficiencies while helping regulators monitor various financial activities and improve interdepartmental information sharing. 
* The Philippines Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said Tuesday that it plans to release trading rules for cryptocurrency exchanges to follow, according to local news outlets.

"**The Dunning-Kruger effect**

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Prompted by Wheeler's bank robbery, two researchers from Cornell University, David Dunning and Justin Kruger, began studying the accuracy of self-assessment. They wondered how people could be such poor judges of their own abilities. Their research was published in a 1999 report titled, ""Unskilled and Unaware of It.""   
&gt;  
&gt;This phenomenon can be particularly frustrating for experts. Time and again you will encounter uneducated, untrained, or unskilled people who think, speak, and act as if they are proficient, when they clearly are not. Charles Darwin recognized this phenomenon when he penned, ""Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge.""  
&gt;  
&gt;As an expert you might prefer that the unskilled people around you knew they were unskilled. But this, unfortunately, is not to be. Experts of all stripes should expect unskilled people to have inflated opinions of their own capability. It is, simply, the way it is. Yet too often experts are surprised and even aghast when they encounter the ""unskilled and unaware.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Unfortunately, there is very little an expert can do to quickly reverse the Dunning-Kruger effect. Confronting the novice will not rectify an inflated perception. Telling the untrained that they are untrained more often fosters resentment than cooperation. Pointing out the failings of the beginner will not reduce his opinion of himself, but it will reduce his opinion of you.  
&gt;  
&gt;It turns out that there is one remedy to the Dunning-Kruger effect but it takes time to accomplish. The better trained a person is at a task, the more proficient that person becomes, and the better judge she becomes of her own skill. And, once a person becomes proficient at a skill his perception of his skills becomes more accurate. He also gains an appreciation for the skills of the truly expert.  
&gt;  
&gt;It is almost always the least skilled people who hold the highest degree of illusory superiority. Even the moderately skilled individuals maintain a higher opinion of themselves than is justified. It is only the truly proficient who underestimate their own abilities.

I remember when I read up about bitcoin/alt-coins and started making some early profits, it was all I could talk about on any social event. I thought people who didn't join this great revolution were foolish, it was a 'once in a lifetime' and the only direction was up. A few friends joined in after I talked about it, mostly because of my confidence on 'how this is the next big thing and can only grow from here'. Some started immediately and made some profits, most lagged in and joined right when mass-media began co-chanting my message....right before the bear market. Those friends are down 80% right now. 

During those months/years, I've been learning valuable lessons about the entire cryptocurrency scene and when I found the above mentioned 'Dunning-Kruger' effect, I noticed that I absolutely went through this entire stage (moreso, I'm still going through it). The lessons haven't always been cheap, but that's what you get for being a cocky loudmouth I guess. Crypto IS complicated, and few people even grasp the biggest part of it all. 

Anybody else who has been through this/or is still going through this?

"The invention of blockchain technology is transforming so many sectors of the global economy, ranging from entertainment, finance, health, Agriculture etc. Due to the transparent, decentralized and trust-less nature of this disruptive technology, many new projects are getting integrated into it on a daily basis. No wonder, THE MAINSTREAM FOR THE UNDERGROUND is taking this huge step of liberating the career of Artist, from those talents that are yet to be discovered, to the upcoming, as well as the music stars through the use of a decentralized platform of the cryptocurrencies. It will interest you to know that music cuts across all ages form infancy, childhood to old age. Also music is represented in every culture, it’s usually described as the food of the soul.

*Europe’s finest up-and-coming comedian is worthy of Ali G in his satirical creation as the head of the fictional ‘Bank of International Settlements’.*

It’s not often that a comedian is brave enough to take on a subject as dry as global banking, but Agustin Carstens — a previously little-known performance artist from Mexico — has successfully done just that. For the last several months, Carstens has been touring Europe, remaining in-character at all times, delivering weighty speeches about the perils facing the global economy from an irresponsible younger generation obsessed with digital cash. We were recently able to take in one of his gigs — and were absolutely blown away by his act.

The genius of Carstens is not in his deadpan delivery — a style long employed by comedians, perhaps most notably the UK’s Jack Dee. It is the sheer perfection with which he walks the unlikely line he has chosen. Watching him perform, unsuspecting audiences are left with the distinct impression that Carstens genuinely believes his own message, and are uncertain whether they should be laughing with him or at him: an unsettling but simultaneously riotously hilarious experience. Just as Sacha Baron Cohen immersed himself in his comic creation [Ali G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_G) — the ‘gangster from Staines’ who mocked his guests and their desperation to come across well to the public by inducing them to agree to his own shocking or ridiculous views — so Carstens takes the role of Head of the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) to a new level of post-ironic satire.

&gt;*‘Carstens is simply superb as the “Head of the BIS”… His figure is larger-than-life, his demeanour entitled, his message strident, his tone increasingly desperate — his comic creation faultless.’*  
*- Cassius (writer and entertainment critic)*

\--------------------------------------

During the course of his ‘presentations’ — delivered to journalists and groups of notable figures from the world of finance and economics — Carstens never once slips out of character, as he harangues the world beyond the cameras about the dangers of digital money and the new economic paradigms it represents. In doing so, he poses the wickedly funny question to the nascent industry he addresses: ‘How dare you try to muscle in on the profits of injustice the banks have monopolised for a hundred years?’

Take this excerpt of one of his most recent interviews, given to the journalist of a major Basel news outlet (the journalist, naturally, is unaware of the comedic nature of Carstens’ endeavour, tacitly accepting the existence of the fictional BIS and thereby flaunting his ignorance of the global economics it is his job to cover). ‘My message to young people would be: Stop trying to create money! … Young people should use their many talents and skills for innovation, not reinventing money. It’s a fallacy to think money can be created from nothing.’

​

With a nod to[ South Park’s Mr Mackey (‘Crypto is bad, mkay?’)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uh7l8dx-h8M), Carstens pleads with the youth of today to give up their naive ways of creating money from nothing. And, like Mr Mackey, who ignores his own classroom diatribe and plunges himself into a lifestyle of drug-taking, Carstens smoothly glosses over the hypocrisy of the world’s central banks, for whom he is the central figure. With the effects of the Global Financial Crisis still undermining the prosperity of ordinary people — and precisely the younger generation he lectures bearing the brunt of the pain they are innocent of causing — the head of the BIS knows better than anyone that central banks have hardly acquitted themselves well. But ‘Central banks are trusted,’ he comments — his composure never once faltering with so much as a smirk at the irony.

#### It is this incisive, biting wit framed by his utterly convincing delivery that makes Carstens the rising star he is and the comedy great he is destined to become. From his evident depth of knowledge of economics (from which he naturally cherry-picks only the most convenient facts for his message) to his imposing physical presence and image as the stereotypical bankster, his commitment to his character is absolute.

Agustin, we salute you!

Intelligently, this platform was structured such that it operates by two different but united tokens, through which it is able to accomplish it's objective of having artist's musical creativity on air as a radical promotional strategy. This makes it easy for the multitude of fans to relate and keep in touch with their most loved music to an end that they would be able to give their indiluted support and be a part of the artists successes.

" I was reading recently on the unbanked population in the world and I was shocked to find out that around 2 Billion adults are unbanked worldwide. 

&amp;#x200B;

 To clarify, being unbanked in the 21st century means that you are unable to have credit score or apply for loans or do any other service you expect to do in the modern 21st century world. This means that the old grandma or the farmer living in 3rd world countries are all unaddressed markets. These people depend on microloans which would have to be paid in around a week at 95% interest rate or something ridiculous like that.  

&amp;#x200B;

 Surely I thought, someone is trying to address this market. I was not wrong there. After some research I came through a few projects. I will just be talking about one here as it already has a real world use case agreement with one Government which makes it closer to reality than many other projects.    

&amp;#x200B;

This was when I came across Sentinel Chain and read their recent Medium post explaining the project. Simply stated ""To deliver sustainable win-win scenarios for all our stakeholders by bringing financial inclusion at speed and scale through disruptive technologies""  

&amp;#x200B;

Sentinel Chain addresses the Unbanked by targeting the livestock as collateral for Banking services. The incentivize the unbanked to utilize their current assets which will be labeled and tracked with RFID tags verify ownership and existence of the livestock which is the to be used as collateral. This allows the unbanked to proceed and use banking services (such as Savings, epayments, credit, investments, and insurance).

"So. I had the most amazing thought on how our daily lives could be changing in the near future while trying to describe cryptocurreny and distributed ledger to a friend last night. The subject started at the basics of blockchain and ended talking about the power of micropayments and smart contracts. 

What got me so excited and blew my mind was the revelation on the possibilities of monetizing microtransactions in driverless cars. See i am of the belief that in the not too distant future autonimous driving will be pushed on us by car manufactures, insurance agencies and the government (much deeper than the conversation here, but sets the stage for the next thought). When we are all being shuttled around by our cars traffic and speed limits will be less of a concern. My thought ght is that cars communicating with one another on a ledger network will operate like packets of information, just speeding along like cars of a train. Ok. Heres the mind blowing idea:

If i decide i need to get to my destination faster i have to incentivize you to cut in front of you. My car pays you a fraction of an iota (for instance) and i jump in front of you. Taken further, when i get in my car i set my priority for getting from point a to b  if i need to get there double quick i essentially pay everyone along the drive for the bemefit of passing them. 

I pay you to pass you, you get to where your going and look for abplace to park, your car parks by a neighbors house (cuz all other spots are taken) so your car pays them to park there...its this entire economy of micro transactions i hadnt even considered. 

Anyway. Maybe you all have already thought of this but i hadnt. I font know if the prospect makes me excited or fearful. But i do see how it could work and how ingrained crypto will become as a part of our daily lives.

"🧠  Lisk Sidechain GNY.io opens ICO with a Cointelegraph Announcement!  🧠

The five big takeaways from this Reddit announcement post and the reasons I am interested in this project include.... 

(1) It is not a fork. It's actually a real Lisk sidechain. 

(2) Lisk funds collected during the GNY ICO will be locked up, thus making Lisk tokens rarer, and you know what usually happens to the price of something rare. 

(3) You will be investing in a new blockchain, not one built on ETH etc. 

(4) The Child Rescue Coalition charity which rescues victimized children will have no transaction fees for use of the GNY machine learning blockchain in their quest to track down predators. 

(5) Using Lisk as payment when taking part in the GNY ICO will result in you gaining tokens in two machine learning blockchain projects. So say if you were just invested in Lisk, and you then went and invested some of your Lisk into the GNY ICO, it would mean you end up invested in three projects (Lisk, GNY, and a Lisk sidechain with machine learning capabilities); thus deversifying your portfolio somewhat.",🧠 Lisk Sidechain GNY.io opens ICO with a Cointelegraph Announcement! 🧠,CryptoCurrency

"A friend with very basic crypto and tax information asked me if he is supposed to pay tax or not for below scenario. I said definitely Yes. But he thinks because he didn’t receive tax forms from his exchange, then it means No Tax. This made me doubt my answer too. Would you please comment with your idea if he is supposed to pay tax or not and if yes, why he didn’t receive any tax form from his US based exchange company.

(I simplified numbers)
September 2017 He bought 20 Bitcoins for $50,000
October 2017 He sold 20 Bitcoins for $100,000.
November 2017 He could buy only 10 Bitcoins for $100,000, so he bought it.
End of December 2017 His 10 Bitcoins just worth $50,000.
January until August 2018 His 10 Bitcoins still worth only around $50,000 and he didn’t touch them (buy or sell anymore)

What I say is he made $50,000 (and used it to buy Bitcoin) in 2017 and he gotta pay tax
He says he DID NOT cash out the money from exchange and he used it to buy back Bitcoin and literally whatever he made is already lost IF HE SELLS HIS BITCOINS NOW. Actually he is in deficit now.

**1. Personal risk**

If everyone knows how much money you have, criminals can decide that you are a worthy target to be attacked for your money.

If you are lucky, the attack will only be digital but, in many known cases, it gets physical as well.

This puts you and your loved ones at great risk.

​

**2. Targeted ads**

If your finances are easily followed and, let's say, sold to advertising agencies that show you ads based on your spendings, other people besides yourself might end up seeing these ads and learning what you are buying.

Even with legal harmless stuff, it might be a liking or a need that you'd prefer to keep private.

There's actually a real life example of a father learning his daughter was pregnant because of the ads that were directed to her.

​

**3. Business privacy**

For a business, having your finances transparent and available to anyone can cause serious damage.

Imagine if your competitors knew all about your revenues, margins, suppliers, the salaries of your employers, etc.

​

**4. Commercial leverage**

What if a company knew that you had a lot of money and wouldn't hurt you to pay three times the price they usually charge on a product?

They could easily show ""special prices"" for you on their e-commerce website based on how much they think you're going to pay.

​

**5. Miner censorship**

If your address is easily found and connected to you, miners can join forces to censor your transactions by actively not adding it to their proposed block.

Why would they do that? For numerous reasons, including government pressure, business interest or just wanting to see the world burn.

​

**6. Fungibility**

Good money has to be fungible, that is, all ""chunks"" of money have to be equally accepted no matter its origin.

That is the reality with cash. No one can refuse your cash or try to prosecute you just because the person who paid you got the money selling drugs.

If it weren't fungible, every bill would effectively be worth a different value (dirty notes would be worth less than clean ones) and the money wouldn't work.",Why privacy of cryptocurrency matters?,CryptoCurrency

"Hi r/cryptocurrency, I'm looking for suggestions on websites/blogs/magazines that offer analysis and long-form writing on happenings in the crypto space. Medium has a fair amount of stuff but I keep getting old articles in my feed, and either way I'm looking to get some new perspectives on board. Current reading list (fuelled by Reddit posts too) consists of The Next Web's Hard Fork section, CCN, CoinCentral, Toshi Times. Some tweetstorms have some solid gold content but there aren't nearly enough. Mainstream media doesn't really give much of the depth I'm looking for, and forums are rabbit holes of information that take too much digging to find the good stuff. Got absolutely no interest in listicles and hype-centric publications, there are more than enough of those out there.

"Bip47 allows a payment reciever to send a reusable code to a sender that allows the sender to privately create a new address to send crypto on-chain.

OpenCAP is a protocol that allows a reciever to associate an address (or payment code :) with a human readable alias, like mine: ""donate$ogdolo.com"". 

Combined these improvements allow users to send and receive transactions privately while also allowing wallets to offer a ""cash app"" experience. We can have human readable contact lists in out wallets!

For more info check out the GitHub:
https://GitHub.com/OpenCAP/protocol

Or a free to use implementation:
https://ogdolo.com

We still needs wallets to integrate with the OpenCAP protocol, if you have a favorite wallet let them know. I'm not a wallet dev, I'm a backend guy, but I would be willing to assist with any integrations.

"Hello /r/CryptoCurrency readers,

&amp;#x200B;

My team is looking for someone that is all about cryptocurrencies. This subreddit seems the place to be for this request! I think there should be a few people on this subreddit with the right mindset and experience in crypto. Anyways, we've been in the crypto scene for quite some time and we reached the point where we're lacking innovation and creativity. It would be great to see things from another person's perspective. We also just don't really have the time on our hands anymore to keep up with all the new projects that are being launched. So we're also looking for someone with experience in the ICO atmosphere, that could research ICOs and find us the next ICON or Wanchain for example. 

&amp;#x200B;

We're looking for an experienced, dedicated and motivated ICO researcher/investor that will find us upcoming projects, so we can analyse the team and the whitepaper and look if we have connections within that project. If there's enough demand within the team we can try to negotiate a deal for the private presale. 

&amp;#x200B;

You must be 18+, have a (very) good knowledge of the English language, have at least 5 months experience in crypto/ICOs and be able to have meetings multiple times a week (online). If you do not meet the age or experience requirement, convince me why you're still suitable for the job. We prefer someone with experience in investing in stocks/real estate and/or with a business/computer science/IT education. Your benefit lies in the fact that you'll build up international connections and will be able to participate in the early stages of ICOs, rather than attending public token sales.

&amp;#x200B;

If you're interested, send me a PM and let me know who you are and what your past ICOs are for example, so we can get to know each other and find out if there's a match. Thank you for reading and I'm looking forward to your PM!

&amp;#x200B;

Kind regards,

Nico",Looking for likeminded ICO researcher/investor,CryptoCurrency

"I understand this argument. First off, it's wrong, because my grandma has no idea what Bitcoin is, and actually, the majority of people I talk to over 25 still don't know what it is.

Still, let's assume people who say this are *correct*. We now live in a world where everyone knows what Bitcoin is, and hopefully understands a little about alt-coins, or at least that there are competitors to Bitcoin that will be able to scale to handle the masses.

Well, as many have stated, the market growth of cryptocurrency has mostly been speculative growth, and very little natural growth. What I mean by that is that very few people in the space are using crypto for every day monetary transactions and are using it as a stock or a store of value (sorry guys, this is not the sole purpose of cryptocurrency.)

The only people who have used crypto as it was meant to, and have spurred the first natural growth of Bitcoin were the people using it on the Onion net, people like Overstock using it to get rid of fees, Bitwage using it to get rid of ACH fees, Bitpay, purse.io, etc.

Real market growth in the cryptocurrency space will happen when using cryptocurrency becomes a *necessity*. When a market crash causes printing of money and hyperinflation, or when a foreign bank decides to start spending the USD they have and in turn introduce a lot more circulating USD to the market, causing the buying power of the dollar to crash, *hard.* Listen to people like Peter Schiff to understand what I mean. People like him are predicting one of these to happen in the next 6ish years. He says buy gold, but whatever.

We're seeing this on a smaller scale in Venezuela. *Necessity* has driven people to adopt crypto, and there's a flourishing black/gray market because of it. In Venezuela, from what I've heard, people don't even know about crypto, or at least know of it only in passing.

Imagine, now, that something Venezula-like would happen to the USD or Euro, GBP, etc, *and* everyone's grandma knew about crypto! Usage would absolutely skyrocket as people's trust of fiat was shattered. At that point, you would have *natural*, *organic* growth, and even attempts to regulate crypto would not affect the price, because it's no longer a speculation commodity, but an actual currency being used as a replacement of fiat.","""Everyone and their grandma knows about Bitcoin.

"Back when I started mining in December and January, I had no idea what I was doing... As most of us, I started throwing shit around to see what works and what didn't. During that process, I was creating accounts, wallets, 2fa... At the time, I wasn't sure how to store that information without the risk of losing it. (2fa codes, seeds, private key) So, I threw them on my Google drive in random places. Fast forward 3 months, I got a hardware wallet and moved the majority of my assets there...

Since January, my Mining rig has grown from 1 card to 12, along with some cpu mining and Storj hard drive farming... So, I have rigs spread out everywhere... My problem with that was access to all these rigs... Here comes in Google Remote Desktop... You need signed into Chrome to get that started... When you sign into Chrome, all your shit syncs...

So, anyway... Last Monday I got a text alert from Coinbase with access code... At first I thought it was spam... But, I changed my password anyway... I then went into my Meta Mask to do some house keeping from over the weekend and then I saw.... The outgoing transactions.... The person got my eth, OMG and Storj tokens... I logged into my Nano account and that was empty too... Checked Binance and it was empty too.

All in all, it was 350$ at current prices as of last Monday that was stolen... I'm thankful that 85% of my assets were on the hardware wallet.

I had 2fa phone authorization set up for my Google account, so I'm guessing they gained access to one of my Mining rigs and brought up my Gmail account, searched keywords (I can see that within my activity) and then found info and moved to my Google drive and found everything else they needed.

Since then, I have removed all crypto related stuff out of my drive (thankfully I never put my hardware wallet info there) I also re-set all my 2fa accounts and wrote them down rather than copying. Form there, I've signed out of Chrome on all rigs and Uninstalled it. I've also checked all internet browsers to ensure that I'm not signed in anywhere. If I do have to sign into something, I ensure that it's signed out before I'm out of the rigs.

So, anyway.. Painful lesson to learn.. But, I'm glad to learn it early rather than next year when it could have been worse...

So, make sure your shit is secure and leave no evidence laying around... Make these slum lords work on getting their own shit rather than taking yours.

"It dawned on me today, I have no idea where to withdraw fiat. So if a bull market were to happen and coins like Tron (hypothetically) became worth $10 each, this would create a whole lot of millionaires, where would we be able to trade then withdraw large amounts of AUD? Btc markets seems to allow $8k a day.. any one done this or know how/where?","In a bull market, where would we cash or large amounts? (Australia)",CryptoCurrency
"Everyday I go into Coinbase and put in a non-executed order for $100, $200, $500, $1000 just to test what the % fee is for the day. At times the fee is 100bps and the spread is low ~ 25bps. At times the fee is 300bps and the spread is high ~ 75bps.

If Coinbase has a demand based fee structure, then this fee is a trailing indicator in general, but a leading indicator that buy pressure is accelerating or decelerating.

Alternatively if the fee is assessed on buys and sells equally (the above paragraph assumed it's not even, more people buy instantly then move to cb pro / gdax to trade at no cost and transfer at no cost) then higher fees deteur selling while lower fees entice buying.

Note that on average the fee is 150bps with a 50bps spread for about 2% on buys. *I never sell on Coinbase, only gdax.*",Theory: Coinbase instant buy fees change based on demand and are an indicator of market direction.,CryptoCurrency

I am still trying to figure out what has happened, however I think I got the hang of it. Despite my time in crypto and my general awareness of security flaws, I have made one big mistake.

My funds were mostly saved on a Ledger Nano S and some on my Exodus wallet (for mining, buying stuff, donating etc.).

It is crucial to understand that I have bought my Ledger and created the Exodus wallet in the first months of me getting into Crypto, and therein lies the mistake.

​

Even though you should NEVER DO THIS, I saved the keywords on my harddrive. I encrypted them with a password and saved them in a protected folder, but I must have forgotten to delete the raw txt files with the keywords on it (as said, one small mistake).

​

On Aug 31st both of my accounts (BTC &amp; ETH on Exodus and BTC &amp; XRP on Ledger) got emptied in a matter of seconds.

​

I know that it was my fault and a very expensive and dumb mistake to make, but back then, I simply was not aware of the danger of seed phrases and simply forgot the raw txt files on my harddrive. A few days ago some sort of malware must have scanned my files and found the seeds. I did not open, display or even have been in the corresponding folder for months (so a keylogger/display logger is highly unlikely to have captured them).

Furthermore my laptop was just sitting at home with nobody but me having access to it.

​

​

To provide some proof, here are the corresponding transactions (as you can see multiple people must have gotten scammed like my):

BTC:

f6fa5f91e7d74f04c01f82b1c5ecbcfcbd0f87306cd6911f78fb38321cffdb19

​

ETH:

​

​

I don't know what to do next, but let this be a warning to everyone. Even though it was just about 5000€ and some people got scammed for much more: NOTHING is save. You can try to protect your funds, but making one small mistake can compromise everything you have worked for.

​

I know it was my mistake and I should have known better, but if you want to donate something (of course only if you want to), here are some addresses:

BTC:  17SFvDsoTwPPJnmXWYeLQSXAdN1aGnkMxR 

ETH:  0x12502c85267148643eA6fA654CC7567DD893A25B

"We are always told that one of the best thing about bitcoin is it’s scarcity. Specifically that there will only ever be a maximum of 21 million bitcoins. All cryptos could be said to have similar properties.  

What I can’t quite get my head around is the significance of this scarcity when each bitcoin can be divided into 100 million satoshis.  We can then say there are 2.1 quadrillion units of bitcoin.  I get that it can’t be printed upon demand and this has great value.  

But can someone help me understand what makes a number like 2.1 quadrillion scarce, in relation to the dollar and gold, and also as it relates to other crypto currencies max token supplies? ",Question re: Crypto Scarcity,CryptoCurrency

"DATUM is a decentralized and distributed high performance NoSQL network backed by a blockchain ledger. It allows anyone to securely and anonymously backup structured and input of multiple types of data from social networks, wearable, smart homes, and other IoT devices. The blockchain empowers users by regaining control of how their data gets used and shared. Users are also incentivized to use the network for data storage, not only by privacy but also by monetization incentives. In a nutshell, it provides a marketplace where users can share or sell data on their own terms.

BENEFITS
●Users
They can submit data, these can be personal, collected business data, data from IOT devices or any other data source.
●Storage Nodes
Computer power and storage capacity are provided to miners for efficient storage of data in the decentralized network. Storage Nodes are one of the major pillars that allows Datum to provide global scale storage of submitted data.
●Data Consumers
Users can decide to grant data access selectively or even sell (based on the terms) their data to trusted entities of choice.
Privacy is assured by marking each piece of data in the network with usage terms during the encryption. Through this, the user or the data source can control their data to suit their need. The usage terms are controlled by the DAT token smart contract.

USE CASES

For Email receipts, financial data, Household Device Graphing, KYC Document storage, tokenizing consumer data for enterprises; Datum network is utilized through the following:
A. User submits a piece of data to the Datum Network using the client software. The user pays gas to submit the data. As the data is encrypted, only the user can provide a decryption key to all the interested parties.
B. A Storage Node receives the data and stores the data. The data is replicated to many other storage nodes.
C. A Data Consumer declares interest to purchase the piece of data. The User receives a data purchase request with the details such as purchaser and price offered. He can agree to the purchase request or counter offer with a modified proposal.
D. The User accepts the proposal, the user receives DAT Tokens and the decryption key is sent to the Data Consumer who pays in DAT Tokens.",Datum Introduction.,CryptoCurrency

we complain that the evil banks are freezing our accounts, do stuff with our money or take fees for transactions.

this is EXACTLY what every exchange does as well.

There are more and more details about fake volumes on Exchanges. They do that so it becomes more attractive for ICOs to get listed, which leads to higher fees for that listing.

Look at these ridicioulus profits exchanges are making. These profits come from our pockets.

"I wanted to share a trading competition the upcoming exchange Covesting (COV) is going to have. Each participant will be given a predetermined and equal amount of Ethereum and will compete for getting the highest percentage gains within a given time frame. 

It is to promote the trade feature that will be a core part of the Covesting platform which is the copy trade feature. Investors will be able to follow traders using COV tokens as means of entry to ""copy"" the trades of any trader of your choosing. 

I've been following this project for several months. Their professionalism combined with the transparency of their project is exciting. The COV team strives to embrace regulation in order to protect those who use the exchange. They are pursuing the first DLT license from Gibraltar in order to be strictly regulated and audited by new rules and regulations in the cryptocurrency space. This is unlike a vast majority of exchanges out there. Here is a link to their latest update!

https://medium.com/covesting/soft-launch-of-the-covesting-platform-what-to-expect-95c14e105039

If you want to be a participant in the competition keep following the project, how to sign up will be announced in the coming week or two. Thanks.",Upcoming exchange Covesting (COV) to begin trading competition shortly!,CryptoCurrency

I guess my major complaint would be the fact that they close every support request I put in without solving the problem or even as much as responding to the ticket itself. I often have to reopen the ticket multiple times just to get someone to actually look at the problem and fix it. I've been reading about multiple other accounts of people being frozen due to what seems to be spite. Am I alone and experiencing the absolutely terrible customer service? Is it just a small amount of people having problems with them?

"DAX is a decentralized solution for personal data exchange. The platform is designed to connect data owners (individuals) and data consumers (various enterprises, non-profits and research companies). The DAX marketplace will be based on a multi-token architecture. The system will employ three tokens. DAX ERC721 token will be linked to the consumer’s identity as they sign up to claim their data. DAX token will be used to access data, stake insertion orders and redeem rewards. DAX ERC20 token will be offered to investors and act as a registered security.

DAX can also be traded on Indodax exchange. Indodax is one of the major exchanges in Indonesia with a high transaction volume. With the entry of DAX into the Indodax market, it is expected to add token types that can be traded there. And with the high trading volume will make DAX become one of the tokens that are in demand by investors and will have a high selling value in the future.

Hopefully, in the future the project from DAX tokens can be successful and get a place in the hearts of investors. So that it can be one of the choices in investing in cryptocurrency other than coins, altcoins, and tokens that already exist first. And in the end it has a high selling value with more and more enthusiasts from investors and traders around the world. That's a bit about DAX tokens which are one of the cryptocurrency products. Hopefully, it can be a token that is used by the community throughout the world as an investment and trading asset. We always support DAX as one of the famous tokens and has a high selling value.

"I saw couple of posts about them on Reddit and read their AMA they held last week. It is a small team that consists mostly of developers (7 out of 10 members of the team). 

The use case makes sense (at least to a layman like me) and covers a unique angle - decentralized databases that can be used in real-time. 

However, someone more tech savvy would make a better assessment of this use case so that is why I posted it here.

Here is a more detailed description of Fluence from their AMA:

"I'm a big fan of Enigma - no drama, no shilled advertising, no 'pay to play' nonsense in terms of marketing, and a stud team. Intel took a leap of faith in working with them ([https://newsroom.intel.com/editorials/intel-advances-silicon-based-security-ai-blockchain-workloads/](https://newsroom.intel.com/editorials/intel-advances-silicon-based-security-ai-blockchain-workloads/)) and the more I search the more I find just how aggressive Enigma has been in the space since 2015. Oddly enough, they sought to remove content from the web as if to keep things under wraps, yet I can still find some articles that show just how aggressive they've been and how far ahead they are of other projects in the space:[http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF\_Value\_Healthcare\_report\_2018.pdf](http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Value_Healthcare_report_2018.pdf)

Whether 99% of altcoins are shit or not, we all come to the same conclusion, even the ultra-bears who bash Bitcoin daily - blockchain technology is the future. What Enigma is doing with secret contracts, TEE, and if they deliver on MPC (they will if anyone can), the technology and protocol is vital to the blockchain realm itself. Not some random use-case or a product running on a blockchain, but an actual integral component to blockchain itself.

Idk, but I like to follow the money. Pantera Capital invested, Intel publicly associated themselves with a working partnership, the team is actually from MIT and not some random guy who held a seminar in the school's lab once. If they can deliver on their MPC ambitions, I can't see why this isn't a top 20-30 coin all day long and surviving long term. I'm genuinely asking for reasons not to go into Enigma deeper, or why people may be staying away (or if it's just not on the radar yet).

"**Ray with Constellation at Techcrunch**

The CEO of hello kitty is attending Techcrunch together with the Constellation team. It were earlier leaked that Ray was an advisor to the team, and now it looks like he might be more than just an advisor. 

 

**Why is this important?**

Ray was responsible for taking Hello Kitty from 300m marketcap to 6.5b.

Until recently, Ray was the Managing Director of Sanrio Co., Ltd (owner of the wildly popular Hello Kitty brand), and he had executed Sanrio’s global expansion strategy. He not only made Hello Kitty a global iconic brand, but also succeeded in acquisition of a UK brand named Mr. Men Little Miss and bringing the franchise to Hollywood. As a global strategist, he’s seen the market cap rise from $500 million to $3.5 billion in seven years after he joined the company in 2008.

" As of today, Smilo has opened its private sale!

We have conceptualised a bonus system that will be of real value to you as potential investors. There has also been significant progress in the development of our platform. As such we are now able to present our prototype to trusted investors and venture capitalists, demonstrating the unique benefits of the Smilo Platform to the blockchain society.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/24doga2ysuk11.png

To accommodate our private investors better, we have decided to implement a variable bonus program, which will be defined by the time of entry, the vesting period, and the size of the investment. This variable set-up has been chosen for four major reasons:

* To incentivise early investors
* To reward commitment to our journey for the long term.
* To reward large investments.
* To avoid any tactics which could harm the stability of our platform

This combination will result in a bonus tailored to your specific requirements. On [smilo.io/ico](https://smilo.io/ico) you can find the necessary tools to calculate your specific bonus.

Furthermore, to protect all our investors from any major trading fluctuations, we have decided to gradually release your tokens, spread equally over your selected vesting period. So from the launch of our mainnet to the end of your specific vesting period, we will release a proportionate percentage of your Smilo and SmiloPay each week.

Last but not least, we have decided to use globally recognized SAFT agreements in the private sale process. Moreover, we will execute our public sale upon the launch of our mainnet in Q2 of 2019, and from that point onwards, we will directly release Smilo to the public. The public sale is planned to actively involve our community into our cause and recognize them for their interest in the Smilo Platform.

The maximum cap for the private sale is 13,6 million USD. Once achieved, we will continue with our public sale of 4,4 million USD to reach our targeted total funding of 18 million USD.

If you would like to participate in our private sale, please register [here](https://smilo.io/register/index) and we will provide you with instructions and a tailored SAFT agreement.

"What major players entering the crypto space are trying to do right now: anchor market movements to their actions.

The fact is: the market didn`t dump because of their statement - which, surprise surprise - was just a joke, right friends? ;D
Goldman and alliance were the ones dumping into the market. This was a shake-out before the mark-up. Don't forget, banks are deep into this. They just don't tell you straight because they are not stupid. 

They want to make the herd believe that their will or intentions actually have any influence in this market. The more people believe this, the more power they get, and easier it gets to manipulate the market. For the first time in decades, we have a market where the status quo doesn't have a major advantage on average players. Let us not lose it. 

Don't forget: the power is in our hands. 
Most of us are not top trades and do not have access to cutting edge HFT and A.I. software. If we gamble our tokens away in the market, they accumulate more. If we hodl, they lose.

"Just another warning not to make yourself a target to those who are interested in stealing from you: 

I had my email, Instagram and Bittrex accounts hacked this morning and my Bittrex account was totally drained.

I was following one Crypto news account on Instagram that account led about 5 other Crypto news accounts following me and as far as I can tell I was targeted because of it. My email password was the weak point but I figure they decided to make an attempt at it because of Instagram. They changed all of my Instagram information (name/password/picture) presumably just to fuck with me and I never got any warning because they already had access to my email account and were intercepting the verification emails. The account was changed to have a Russian email address but my Bittrex account appears to have been accessed from somewhere in Amsterdam. 

I should have known better than to have followed them and I double fucked up because I somehow didn't have 2FA set up on Bittrex (I was certain that I did).


They traded everything I had into BTC and then sent it off to this address: 13NEHoWSH4odMWfxfAm8h4ESHE5pdjeWzu. I didn't have a whole lot in there because of the currently shit market (lost about .13 BTC) but this whole situation really sucks regardless. I reached out to Bittrex to see if anything can be done but I pretty much already know the answer to that.

### Developments in Financial Services

* Apex Clearing, a digital financial clearing and execution company, announced Wednesday of plans to launch a new cryptocurrency brokerage subsidiary. As a result, Apex’s clients, who are primarily wealth management and financial advisory firms, will have access to investment opportunities in cryptocurrencies. Initially in its brokerage service, Apex will include Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and Ethereum before expanding to other coins.   
* The Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) has announced a six-month delay in the rollout of a specialized  blockchain to facilitate equity transactions. ASX has been working to implement the blockchain since December 2017 and had plans to launch in late 2020. However, with the six-month setback, ASX will not launch the blockchain until March or April of 2021. ASX cited plans to devote more time to user development and testing in explaining its decision to delay the blockchain’s launch.

* The ASX is delaying the roll-out of a blockchain settlement system until 2021.  After receiving 41 written submissions form various stakeholders in the process (clearing &amp; settlement, payment providers, market operators, etc), ASX management decided it makes sense to delay implementation and extend the development testing period.  
* Bittrex announced it is partnering with Cryptrofacil to launch a cryptocurrency trading exchange for Latin America.  The new exchange will be based out of Uruguay.  
* Coinbase announced Thursday of plans to roll out new crypto trading pairs for the British pound.

Coinbase Pro already offers trading services for the pound against bitcoin.

* ResearchandMarkets.com forecasts that the crypto ATM industry will grow to USD$114.5mm by CY2023 and implies a per annum growth rate of \~54.7%.  The company suggests the majority of the growth will come from two-way ATMs which let customer change digital currency into fiat and vice-versa.  Furthermore, the reported by ResearchandMarkets.com posits that that the majority of the crypto ATMs will be based in North America.   At the moment, crypto ATM industry is forecasted to be \~USD$16.3mm.  
* Robinhood, the mobile zero-fee investment app, revealed Thursday that the firm is actively looking for a CFO while citing ‘definite’ plans for the firm to go public. Robinhood CEO Baiju Bhatt expanded, saying, “it’s definitely on the horizon, not in the immediate term, but that’s something we are thinking about.”  

### Regulatory Environment

* After making a controversial move to hold themselves to know-your-customer (KYC) regulations, ShapeShift exchange is facing criticism from users across the crypto industry. In explaining their decision, CEO Erik Voorhees explained that the idea of requiring customers to hand over private information is something the exchange has struggled with for a long time, but they believe this is the best decision to help the firm navigate the regulatory environment.   
* Breugel, a Belgium-based think tank, argues that the EU should create a single standard for regulating cryptocurrencies for the Euro-bloc.  The group believes there should be common regulations for crypto exchanges and ICOs.  
* Global crypto wallet Abra will begin enabling the direct purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies with European bank accounts, the company announced Tuesday in a press release. Users will now be able to transfer euros and other national currencies into their wallet, which can then be used to purchase any of 28 cryptocurrencies offered by the crypto wallet.

* Members of the European Parliament met Tuesday to review a proposal of regulatory framework that would surround initial coin offerings (ICO). If passed, the proposal would cap token sales of an ICO at EUR 8 million and hold offerings to know-your-customer/anti-money-laundering regulations. The framework would allow projects to raise funds in any of the 28 EU member nations.   
* The Philippines Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said Tuesday that it plans to release trading rules for cryptocurrency exchanges to follow, according to local news outlets. The Philippines has been an early mover in crypto regulation, having already published regulatory framework for initial coin offerings and requiring actual registration of crypto exchanges.  
* A high-ranking official of Ukraine's Finance Ministry, Sergey Verlanov, explained in an interview that Ukrainians are expected to pay the regular 19.5% income tax on profits from crypto related activities. Verlanov went on to add that while cryptocurrencies have no official legal status in Ukraine, they are common items deemed intangible assets.  
* An order issued by Uzbekistan President Shavkat Mirziyoev on Sunday states that Uzbekistan will no longer charge tax on cryptocurrency related income and that licensed cryptocurrency exchanges will not be held to the country’s securities and exchanges regulations. This announcement comes as Uzbekistan is attempting to attract cryptocurrency related businesses to the country.  

### General News

* Andreas Antonopoulos, Bitcoin evangelist, believes Bitcoin ETFs will be negative for Bitcoin long-term as it will let investor speculate about its price more easily.  Antonopoulos believes a Bitcoin ETF will permit market makers to manipulate Bitcoin markets and that individual investors would move away from playing an important part in the decision-making process of the cryptocurrency ecosystem (since they would inevitably shy away from the responsibilities of owning Bitcoin key).  
* Bill Barhydt, CEIO of cryptocurrency payment startup Abra, during an interview on CNBC’s Coin Rush, suggests the SEC is rejecting Bitcoin ETFs because the applicants don’t “fit the mold of who the SEC is used to approving.”  Barhydty suggests a trusted financial organization has better probability of getting a Bitcoin ETF approved than a startup.  
* Bitcoin Depot has launched 20 crypto ATMS in California to bring its total global installed base to 160.  The company expects to reach 200 installed ATMs globally by year-end.  With an install rate of 7 ATM/months, Bitcoin Depot may not reach its management goal of 1,000 installed Bitcoin ATMs by CY2020.  
* Bitcoin’s market capitalization is back to 55% of total digital currency market capitalization, the highest level since December 2017.  
* Bitmain’s AntPool has activated AsicBoost, a controversial method of mining Bitcoin more efficiently.  AsicBoost exploits a previously known weakness in Bitcoin’s proof-of-work algorithm that allows for faster mining. Bitmain notably holds a patent in China for a system that exploits the Bitcoin network’s weakness in order to increase mining productivity.  
* Bitfi, previously advertised as an unhackable Bitcoin wallet, has withdrawn its claim that it is not hackable after cybersecurity researchers were able to discover serious security flaws in Bitfi’s technology.  
* Bittrex has decided to delist Bitcoin Gold following failure by the cryptocurrency to pay Bittrex the monthly listing fee of USD$262,907. 
* Blockchain identity startup Civic has decided to use 333 million of its 1 billion supply of CVC token (\~USD$43mm) to pay for the costs of identity checks of users on its platform as well as stress-testing the protocol.   
* Blockstream VP Warren Togami warned investors on Tuesday of a possible ‘51 percent’ attack on Bitcoin Cash’s blockchain. With a hashrate below 8% of Bitcoin’s , Togami warned that a ‘51 percent attack’ could render the cryptocurrency useless. In his rantings on Twitter, Togami cited Bitcoin Cash’s similarity to Feathercoin, a cryptocurrency who’s ‘51 percent’ attack left the coin obsolete.   
* Cannabis publication, High Times, reported Wednesday that they would be accepting cryptocurrency for its ongoing initial public offering (IPO). High Times initially announced that it would accept bitcoin and Ethereum in the beginning of August; however, it rolled back on its announcement citing regulation issues. Despite the rollback, it appears that bitcoin has remained a payment option in the publication’s IPO.   
* Cryptocurrencies underwent a harsh selloff Wednesday morning with the top 100 coins losing $12 billion of market cap in just one hour. Most notably, Bitcoin’s price dipped below the $7,000 level and Ethereum lost more than 11% in the last 24 hours. CNBC crypto analyst Ran NeuNer cited that a possible reasoning for this price move could be a large sell-off of digital assets from a crypto wallet that may be associated with the infamous Silk Road.   
* Google is rolling out an update to its Big Data service that will help investors “visualize” the Ethereum blockchain.  The platform, BigQuery, will permit users to visualize behavior and clustering on the Ethereum blockchain.  
* IBM announced today of a partnership with Hu-manity.co to develop a ‘health data application that utilizes blockchain technology. This is not the first time the tech giant has partnered on a blockchain related projects, announcing partnerships earlier in the year with SecureKey and Sovrin.   
* According to iPR Daily, Alibaba and IBM have filed the largest number of blockchain-related patents to date.  Alibaba has filed for 90 different blockchain-related patents while IBM has filed 89.  Mastercard is 3rd on the list at 80.  
* Japanese city Tsukuba has officially become the first Japanese city to test a voting system that leverages blockchain technology. The blockchain voting system allows citizens to vote on different social contribution project proposals, such as the construction of a cheap sporting facility and the creation of a new cancer diagnostics center. 
* A malware that targets Bitcoin ATMs is on sale in underground markets for approximately US$25,000 according to Trend Micro. The malware exploits a service vulnerability and utilizes Near-Field Communication or pre-written cards that are provided to the buyers of the malware.   
* The Mega Chrome extension for the Chrome internet browser has been compromised.  Hackers can now steal a user’s Monero as well as sensitive information according to chatrooms on Reddit and posts on Twitter.  
* The People’s Bank of China announced Tuesday that it has officially launched the testing phase of its blockchain trade finance platform, according to the Shanghai Securities News. The new blockchain aims to provide an “open financial and trade ecosystem based on the Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macau Bay are.” The new blockchain should help banks conduct business authenticity audits, slash business costs, and improve efficiencies while helping regulators monitor various financial activities and improve interdepartmental information sharing.   
* Ripio, an Argentinian startup that ICO’d last year, has launched its full service, offering microloans to some 200,000 bitcoin wallet users in Argentina. Ripio’s blockchain connects lenders with borrowers from across the globe by leveraging Ethereum smart contracts. Ripio said its microloans can be issued for as much as US$730 and its average loan size is around $146.  
* Rising RAM costs are making the costs of EOS dapps cost prohibitive for developers.  RAM, according to analysis by CoinDesk.com, has to be bought at market prices using EOS, with trades taking place on the Bancor algorithm.  Each EOS dapp user takes 4 kilobytes of RAM to onboard for developers. According to the current RAM price, that's around $3.12 per user. 
* The South Korean government continues to make a push to invest and trial blockchain technologies in the public sector.  According to CoinDesk.com, The Korea Internet &amp; Security Agency (KISA) is looking to increasing the number of blockchain starter projects in the public sector from 6 to 12 by CY2019.    
* Southeast Asia’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Coins, reported that it tripled its user count over the last fiscal year, going from 1.5 million users to over 5 million users. Coins is located in the Philippines and has grown by aggressively targeting foreign markets, specifically Malaysia and Thailand.

* Wal-Mart plans to begin testing the effectiveness of automated delivery drones based on blockchain protocol. The blockchain technology is meant to replace the elements of the delivery process that is dependent on “trust”.

"I'm sick and tired of seeing the idiotic crypto media regurgitating the post made by an idiot a few days ago that didn't know the actual value of USD in Iran. There is a subsidized official exchange rate, which is a fixed rate of 1 USD to 42K IRR. This rate is only used for imports of a certain category of products designated by the government such as food and medicine.

The real value of USD, the one you pay for other products such as bitcoin, is 1 USD to 140K IRR, as of now. Yes it has depreciated significantly within few months (more than 200%), and yes some people buy bitcoin and other cryptocurrency to hedge against such depreciation and yes government legalized mining and the central bank may soon support crypto to IRR exchange as first true adoption of cryptocurrency. But bitcoin value is same as everywhere else when correct exchange rate is used. 

STOP SPREADING FALSE INFORMATION. Research first, ask local sources. Makes you wonder about other garbage that gets  reported from non-western or non-english speaking countries.","Bitcoin is not 25K USD in Iran, stop spreading false information",CryptoCurrency

"I’m here to share about your ICO team’s need to secure and maximize or protect the value of the raised funds, so your investment will last and grow. 

You see FMF has tiered services and the tokens are encouraged to be used on the platform. A digital asset exchange or an ICO or individual’s access depends on its FMF stake. Basically, the services are for top-notch multisig crypto and fiat custodial services; treasury mgmt with liquidity access to over 95 exchanges for quick and efficient buying and selling digital asset and with an option for P2P lending so extra crypto or cash can earn interest; for payments that has digital fiat withdrawals with full compliance to laws and regulation and/or tru traditional banking with bank partners for international transfers.

So there, simple yet most neglected part of ICO industry – securing and protecting digital assets value. 

You don’t want another bitcoin private story of a developer stealing funds, or an ICO panic selling their ETH, or an ICO that lost the funds through numerous conventions coz the bottom line most affected is YOU- the investor.

This has probably been the case since day one, but appears to be very pronounced in the last few decades. Nobody, even the very rich, use money as a store of wealth, most use real estate to store wealth.

The Auto Block will be running on the HyperLedger Fabric as a private Blockchain to store data and our proprietary fork of the Waves Blockchain to conduct transactions. The token sale will be conducted on the Ethereum Blockchain and all ATC tokens will be ERC-20. Once The Auto Block mainnet is live, all tokens will be swapped for our native ATC token on a 1:1 ratio",The AutoBlock offers solution that aims to benefit the automotive industry as a whole,CryptoCurrency
"Youtube 'influencers'. Coinbase. Bitcoin futures. Goldman Sachs. Bitcoin ETFs. CNN. All they do all day is track the price of fucking Bitcoin and tell you where it's headed in the next days/months/years and why you should buy or sell. They never talk about other projects and they never talk about the actual tech. They do this for two reasons:

1. ***They're entirely aware that Bitcoin is and will continue to be outclassed in every way by multiple other projects.*** In other words, it has no future. The digital gold narrative is complete bullshit. It takes a freakishly long time and a lot of efforts to overcome solely the mathematical difficulties of building a network that scales well, is secure and operates in a way that is economically sound. Even with a dedicated, qualified, focused team with plenty of resources, it's a tough task. When you look at Bitcoin's governance, it's clear that not only do they not have a focused team, it seems to be actively trying to hinder its development for short-term economic gain. 

2. ***Bitcoin is a gatekeeper to the rest of the market that keeps it completely irrational***, because it has gathered a cult of uneducated and wishful investors who cling to it like their life depends on its future. It makes absolutely *no sense* for a currency to be valued in the hundreds of billions with current levels of adoption, subpar tech and the uncertainty that surrounds it, yet everyone is, 8 months after a prodigious bubble still clinging to the hopes of an ETF while a dozen other teams are progressing by leaps and bounds. Bitcoin is the badge that allows dodgy projects to bloom despite their nonsensical business plans and gives birth to micro-cults who congregate in their echo chambers to rehash talking points about technologies they don't understand.

Where's Wall Street in all this? Simple. This market is a prodigious tool for value extraction. The lack of regulation and volatility combined with how easy it is to manipulate quite simply makes it a predatory financial institution's wet dream. However, everything falls apart if Bitcoin does. Bitcoin keeps the whole show running because it's the living proof that fundamentals don't matter as the the space isn't mature enough to price based on valuation.","Bitcoin will never be widely adopted, because it was never meant to be. Corporations and media outlets are establishing a cheap culture that paints public distributed ledgers as quick money and we are all enabling it.",CryptoCurrency

&amp;#x200B;

One great source for me to stay updated with the progress of the TTC Protocol project is the Twitter handle here [https://twitter.com/ttceco](https://twitter.com/ttceco) and the fact I am subscribed to the mailing list as well here [https://www.ttc.eco/ttcprotocol/regisration/](https://www.ttc.eco/ttcprotocol/regisration/) puts me at the top of the ladder of information.  

 In the TTC Protocol Newsletter dialog box click on the preferred language of choice and enter your email then click the submit button, you will get an email notification of your subscription which keeps you informed when there is news. As an avid user of various social media myself this project is relatable to my experience I could understand in clarity what she aim at, going through the several updates including the whitepaper I could clearly understand the need for a decentralized approach to social network and engagements. Apparently global revenue generated from social networks and media is eye opening as well as alarming in terms of revenue generation check out the image of 2013-2019 social media global revenue statistic from [www.statista.com](http://www.statista.com/) below 

 By the end of 2019 social media revenue generation should stand at 39 billion Euros with no plans for its content creators and users who spend their resources and make social media engagement possible besides I am speaking of mainstream social media like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat and the likes. This are centralized social network with centralized servers doing their very best to creating the environment for social interactions but aren’t exactly making the users feel appreciated or secured. The bulk of the flaws of centralized systems are that of security, harmful exposure of user data and lack of control, the better alternative is to go the way of decentralization. If you are not in the know already decentralization is the process by which the activities of an organization in this case social network are distributed or delegated away from a central, authoritative location or group. The technology behind the TTC protocol engine is the Blockchain which made the concept of decentralization popular and commonplace as well owing to its disruptive built and adventurous aims. “The decentralized nature of Blockchain technology means that it doesn’t rely on a central point of control. A lack of a single authority makes the system fairer and considerably more secure” –Lisk.io   

User information on the Blockchain is way more protected than in an centralized system. There have been great shift in recent times from centralization to decentralization owing to the many advantages the later possess against the former. But in a decentralized platform like the TATAUfo the advantages of decentralization are enormous.

"**CEO FORTnightly Message - 07/09/18**

Since I wrote to you last, we have witnessed significant volatility in the markets and, with it, some voices of concerns about where the token industry is heading.  We ignore the naysayers and, regardless of market conditions, look to the future with increasing confidence. There are a number of reasons why, that I‘d like to share with you.
 
The demand for higher standards is now greater than ever before and comes from every corner: governments, regulators, industry, and general consumers. As a result standards, accountability and transparency are improving.  There is of course still work to do on a global level but players such as GBX, in supportive jurisdictions like Gibraltar, continue to take bold steps to help move the industry forward, to increase confidence. The GBX-GRID (token sale platform) and our GBX-DAX (Digital Asset Exchange) are venues where today token issuers, buyers, and sellers can go and be treated honestly and fairly.
 
Furthermore, the emergence of security tokens (securities issued in token form onto blockchains) are the beginning of the next evolutionary step for our industry: to create new products, new markets, widen participation and liquidity, enhance the delivery of service in capital markets, and improve the risk profile of the market’s infrastructure.
 
From our meetings with many people in the industry, including more recently at conferences in London and Singapore, we believe that many are overwhelmed with information on this subject but at the same time, hungry for knowledge and eager for a regulatory compliant solution.
 
Just as we are doing for utility tokens, we at GBX are playing a significant role in providing global leadership on security tokens within the GSX Group. Providing clarity, consistency and certainty on this matter is truly one of the main themes to watch out for now and into 2019. We are eager to share with you our plans soon and we wish for all our ROCKers to join us on this important step in our journey.

In the meantime I have some fantastic updates to share, including some great upcoming announcements, so let's get to it ROCKers!  

**Welcoming CCMC to the Sponsor Firm Network**

"*It’s a like a Hollywood movie.

Thousands of bitcoins sat in numerous  accounts that have been dormant since 2014 have started moving. The  original address and the activity connected to it have been the topic of  an extensive investigation by [reddit user sick\_silk](https://www.reddit.com/user/sick_silk). The total value of those accounts, including BCH and other fork coins, approaches a billion dollars.

In one post he discusses the [origins of the BTC](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9bfnff/near_1b_are_currently_on_the_move_from_a_silkroad/); in another, he shows that [large amounts – around $100 million – have just been moved to Binance and Bitfinex](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9ceb5v/1b_bitcoins_on_the_move_owner_transfers_100m_to/) – suggesting they will be sold for alts and USD respectively.

From the analysis, it seems that the  bitcoins ultimately come from a Silk Road address – the famous dark  market that sold drugs and other illegal items for BTC, and that was  shut down by the FBI in 2013. It appears that the coins were ‘tumbled’  back in 2014, and split among many different addresses. However, it was  still possible to link them back to the original account, which was set  up in 2011, with a transfer associated with Ross Ulbricht: the ‘Dread  Pirate Roberts’ who founded the Silk Road.

Nowadays, the digital asset market has been encountering many problems, including its susceptibility to market volatility and price fluctuations as well as its lack of security and transparency. To address these problems, the DAEX project builds a distributed digital asset clearing ecosystem based on blockchain technology - a secure trusted and open network in which everyone can witness value.The DAEX ecosystem will decouple assets and transactions, enable token-based authentication and restructure the transaction process. This will allow for safer and more efficient distributed registration, clearing and settlement of digital assets. Using this as a foundation, DAEX will serve the entire digital asset market, from digital asset exchanges comprising of multiple interconnected nodes to individual digital asset users.

## What are the advantages of DAEX ecosystem?

The DAEX ecosystem provides the following advantages to participants in the system:

**- Secure:** Thanks to a built-in, smart-contract-based privacy protection protocol which uses chain identification codes, DAEX ecosystem guarantees the objectivity of the clearing process and protect the safety of customers’ assets. User’s assets are all held on the blockchain and cannot be moved without user’s admission.

**- Trusted:** After each completed digital asset transaction, the DAEX clearing and settlement process will ensure that the changes in data are synchronized between all nodes concurrently; therefore providing a reliable environment for exchanges and traders. The blockchain technology guarantees the authenticity of the settlement prices, which are based on composite prices of the underlying asset of participating exchanges.

**- Open:** The DAEX ecosystem is open to new exchanges. This means exchanges that participate in the DAEX ecosystem can utilize all products and services provided by DAEX, such as wallets and clearing. In addition, exchanges can expect to use more value-added services provided byDAEX in the future, including cryptocurrency derivatives trading.

**- More Robust:** With the multiple-part private key, the DAEX ecosystem prevents users from privately keeping and transmitting a complete key. By putting the user at the centre of the process and using a consensus mechanism, it also makes accounting on the distributed ledger more efficient.

**- A Richer User Experience:** The DAEX solution also increases the scalability of the blockchain, enabling fast transactions of multiple assets. At the same time, the basic high-level services of the Clearing Chain can retain the same transaction depth while offering an abundant business ecosystem for derivatives and digital assets.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/gtqbq26r3sk11.png

## Finding out what benefits our society can get from DAEX Tokens

Despite being still in its very early stage, the cryptocurrencies industry has a strong growth potential. The goal of DAEX is to help the industry grow in a more orderly and secure way by providing a solid infrastructure that benefits many industry players.

DAEX provides CaaS (Clearing as a Service) for the cryptocurrency trading industry. Since the operation of this CaaS is objective and transparent, it is an effective infrastructure service to the whole industry. By using this service, the industry becomes unbiased, objective and transparent so that industry resources become more effectively used.

Moreover, as a clearing service, the DAEX Tokens can also provide a more effective way to list digital assets. With the booming of ICO events, selecting quality coins to list and make related business and technology work ready become a very burdensome work for many exchanges. Users can simplify exchange jobs with DAEX wallets. With that, exchanges can be made quickly with the services of DAEX, thereby creating competition in the crypto industry.

 Jun Ho Lee has become the CEO of JIENUM a platform that provides lodge-booking services for travellers while he was majoring Economics at Northwestern University. Jun Ho felt that there were a lot of apps for booking hotel rooms, but younger tourists still were not well-informed about various unique lodging options such as guest houses. He wanted to create a platform to introduce many suitable choices for travellers. Based on more than 1,000 guest home vacation spots in South Korea, Jienem is introducing all of its businesses such as MonStay, EGStay guesthouse franchise, business establishment education, and consignment operations. Among the Korean O2O (online to offline) guesthouses, the only place where the online reservation service and the offline guest house are operated together is Jienem. A giant accommodation reservtation service operator Yanolja made a strategic investment in Jienem company. Jienem also attracted investments from Capston Partners for free series A which is worth $500 million (500 million KRW). This investment is meaningful because VC's investment in startup companies is highly valued and driven by its future growth. Jun Ho was a part of Gookmin University’s entrepreneurship group’s idea that got selected as a part of Korea’s sponsored accelerated program. He has been able to get funding from Angel Investment and OnChina, a Chinese Marketing company. He obtained a valuable work experience from Internship at Nics Co., Ltd, Buk Co., Ltd, JW Pharmaceutical Corporation Intern and Korea Investment &amp; Securities.

"Hey guys, i want to give you my input on the current market and i think everybody here will find some value into what im saying. So as we knew last year, people were making money on the upside but now this year since the market had turn bearish, people found a way to make money on the down side. So now what you see are all these former ‘hodlers’ of last year are now ‘traders’ all of a sudden trying to time bitcoin on bitmex. And from what you seen this year, all these good projects had to suffer because of what bitcoin is doing. This turned these hodlers into traders, dumping their alts to bet against bitcoin. On the whale’s mind or whoever is playing the strings, i think they used their manipulation on bitcoin this year with your touch of fud articles to drive the rest of the market down because they know the alts will drive the next bull run. So now that alt prices are super lower, these btc whales are unloading to your favorite altcoins while all the new wannabe traders are too busy trying to time bitcoin. Long story short, now that bitcoin’s price is obviously manipulated and people are starting to wake up, i think what you’ll see soon is everybody trying to FOMO into alts while the new ‘traders’ calling your bags shitcoins will be left in the dust. I’m feeling bullish my friends.. With that said, is altcoin season here?",My take on the current market,CryptoCurrency

"Hi crypto fans,
I am a 20 year old student who has been following crypto for about a year. Learning about bitcoin has been a life changer. To me a life where bitcoin replaces fiat is a world that I would love to be a part of. For this reason and because of my believe in Satoshi’s ideas, I started accumulating bitcoin. Unfortunately right when I started was on the bounce close to 10k. Almost the entire time I have been accumulating I have been losing money. This has been a blessing in disguise. Over this spring and summer I have been putting all my hard earned cash into crypto. Today I have finally accumulated about 1 BTC. I am not worried about the price in the near term, but am optimistic. I will never sell even if we drop to close to zero. There are only ever going to be 21 million bitcoins. My hope is my family holds after my death. Thanks for reading guys and good luck in the coming years! HODL",No one to tell... so here I am,CryptoCurrency

"All this talk of ""bull runs"" about to occur is pie in the sky. The last bull run occurred when there was a somewhat sudden craze similar to Pokemon in the late 90's last year. Where normal people in society started to FOMO and bought told their friends to do the same and Coinbase saw huge growth along with Google 'bitcoin' searches at an all time high. Most of these normal people who jumped on the easy money gravy train / band wagon sold when they lost 90% of their portfolio and don't want nothing to do with cryptocurrency at the moment. The whales/banks/government/illuminati/michael jackson who are 'manipulating' the market are not going to 'pump' any coins until normal people start using crypto, and while there is Fear, Uncertainty &amp; Doubt bull runs are not going to occur. So what do I think will cause the next Bull run... Adoption. Once some of these products have real working use cases and normal people start using this technology and understanding it more there will be market cap increases that come with it. In my opinion Vechain has the best chance right now at seeing real world use cases. People often speak about Venezeula and how there could be real world use case for Bitcoin /Nano due tothe inflation problem. However I was on the ground there in Caracas a few months ago and a major problem with this is that the USD is the unofficial currency.

Who likes this idea? It seems like it would be fun considering the max anyone can lose is $25 which will not hurt too bad but the reward potential would be enormous. I would even limit monthly amounts anyone can trade because I do believe people should be careful leverage trading crypto.

I just like this project and I think it deserves more attention as devs are working hard on making it work, but there is little to no attention being brought onto this project, that is the reason I am writing this post.

"We all know markets is manipulated, nothing new. Bet here is the reality for you - the markets will NEVER EVER became what it was year ago. We will see more and more manipulated market the more those banksters crooks gets near the crypto. Idiots are happy about BAKKT, but forgets that the same company was responsible for silver price manipulation.

People somehow waiting for tools those crooks are making, trading desks, exchanges. They make those things just to profit from you. They would be able to see shorts, longs, stop loss possitions and bet AGAINST people who using their platform! This is done for decades now.

While for regular guy 1-2% movement do not make profits, for those billion worth companies it's super good profits. Sideway crypto is the reality and will be that way forever, while hey want to.

**Bitcoin can not be stopped-popular fairy tale** \-  It can and very easy. Gov can print whatever amount of currency they want. Gov can overtake mining farms and so on. SO lets say gov builds mining center and gets 51% of BTC hashing power. THen rejects all the transactions. People would make hard fork for new BTC - gov will switch t new blockchain and get 51% hashing power and rejects again transactions. The problem with current system is -it depends on money, who have more money - have more control.  SO gov, banks will always win.

The only possible blockchain system that i see can survive would be the one, that is ""mined"" while people using phones, browsing internet.. doing daily stuff. SO almost all population could become ""miners"".  Best would be special routers that confirms tx, that require no hard calculations to waste energy, but just to proof transaction. Bitcoin and all PoW coins is flawed and can be stopped.

Now everybody listens to some idiot on youtube, twitter who say 7700$ is major resistance!  5800$ is major support.. SO what happens? Many idiots thinks it's true so makes trades based on those numbers. And more people doing the same then those who trade based on emotions and so on. SO price starts to move just like TA ""predicted"". It's not that TA works, is just people to dumb to think, and follows nonsense and makes nonsese to be reality. We do not have bullrun because EVERYBODY thinks that we will go more down, that crypto have some stupid support or resistances. No it DOESNT! People have. And that's why it kills bullrun. You go to look at shorts amount you see it's 5:1 regarding longs, and you become bearish..cause 5x more people shorting..and you starting to short or not buy at ""higher"" price.",Here is red pill for you.,CryptoCurrency
"Today we announced the listing of [$FND](https://ethex.market/#FND) at Ethex. We only list useful tokens, and $FND (Fundrequest) definitely fits that description. We're an exchange with a mission to advance real-world usefulness of blockchain projects, and specifically ethereum-token based protocols, platforms, and dapps.

If you're not familiar with Fundrequest, it's a Github-integrated platform that allows anyone to incentivize resolution of open source issues. I wrote about how it compares to traditional crypto bounties ([https://medium.com/ethex-market/advantages-of-fundrequest-over-traditional-bounties-78b23e81e29c](https://medium.com/ethex-market/advantages-of-fundrequest-over-traditional-bounties-78b23e81e29c)) also check out my screencast of the platform in action where I fund an issue I particularly care about: [https://youtu.be/a5Wwh\_qzVEE](https://youtu.be/a5Wwh_qzVEE)

W. Scott Stornetta is considered to be one of the founding fathers of current blockchain technology.  Out of 8 citations in the Satoshi Nakamoto whitepaper, 3 of them (4 by some accounts) were of the work of Stornetta and his partner and friend Stuart Haber. 

He was a cypherpunk who dedicated his time at Xerox Park and Bell Communications Research to cryptography and distributed computing.   

It was a joy to chat with him about the history of the blockchain, how he learnt about bitcoin, uses of blockchain tech before bitcoin, and what he refers to as ""corporation 2.0"" of the future, where we'll start to see all kinds of power structures become decentralized. ",The Missing Link between Satoshi &amp; Bitcoin: Cypherpunk Scott Stornetta,CryptoCurrency

"Today I received a random outbound transaction on my ERC20 wallet.  I got the notification from Etherscan that I just sent tokens and freaked out that my private keys got compromised.  After doing some digging and following the breadcrumbs from the name of the token I apparently sent, I found out that this outbound transaction of some random token from my wallet was actually an access token to KYC on a new project's ICO/DEX/whatever the heck they're doing KYC for -- I'm not really sure.  

So what is actually going on in this transaction is something that's new to Solidity apparently.  The devs of this new project did this as a way of garnering some attention and showing off that they have found some new functions and features of both Solidity and the Ethereum blockchain (maybe other blockchains too).  I was freaked out at first but then I realized that there's still new and inventive things being discovered and that we haven't hit a roadblock in blockchain development.  I'm not going to mention the name of the company because I don't want to make this into an ad for them, but if you or anyone else you know has either received a token today or sent a token today in your ERC20 wallet that is literally nowhere to be found, you can track them down.  Feel free to PM me if you want to know.  

This is just exciting to me and I wanted to get the word out.

"In the music industry if an artist is appropriately empowered and compensated for his past endeavours he will accomplish more. So if an artist isn't appropriately remunerated there are chances he may pass up a major opportunity.
To ensure adequate compliance with artists rewards and rights led to the creation of a dual token ecosystem known as CYFM (from CyberFM) and MFTU ( from Mainstream For The Underground) token ecosystem. This token ecosystem is based on blockchain technology, thus ensuring decentralization, transparency in related transactions, use of smart contracts etc.
CYFM and MFTU are based on open-source online royalty payment method, which will be used universally to protect the rights and payments of artists, musicians and performers.

I want to take two specific dates so that we can keep this all in mind for reference, and then ask my question. Also, please bear in mind I am not shilling / attacking coins. Even the alts that I am invested in are suffering.

June 7th 2018. Bitcoin's value was 7,649.78 USD.       
Sep 5th 2018. Bitcoin's value (before the plummet) was 7,371.91 USD.       


July 7th 2018. EOS's value was 13.98 USD per coin.       
Sep 5th 2018. EOS's value (before the plummet) was 6.47 per coin.     

June 7th 2018. XRP's value was .66 USD per coin.      
Sep 5th 2018. XRP's value (before the plummet) was .33 USD per coin.      

A lot of this is uniform among all altcoins, not **just** the two I listed above.

"Change my view!

PoW currencies rely on the fact that it takes 51% of the computing power of a network to redo the network's transaction history. Schemes to add more blockchains to the network in an attempt to scale up throughput fracture the amount of computing power necessary to attack any individual blockchain and double spend. 

Without multiple blockchains, PoW currencies can't support asynchronous transactions and can't significantly scale any further. Yes, multiple transactions are being processed in each block, but at the end of the day the network has to wait to collect transactions to synchronize itself, instead of being able to process unrelated transactions (eg, A -&gt; B and C -&gt; D) immediately and in parallel. Increasing block size doesn't work either due to bandwidth capacity constraints, and either way, individual transactions will still take the time between block creation (10 minutes) plus however many iterations of block creations you need to wait to feel secure that the transaction is finalized. 

PoW is dead. ",I don't think that PoW cryptocurrencies can scale without completely compromising their security against double spending or sacrificing decentralization,CryptoCurrency

"You may know that I’m big supporter of Ignite Ratings, it’s no secret. However, I have to admit that when Damon and Chris said how this ICO rating market is corrupted I think they were over exaggerating. I mean, I knew there was an issue, that’s why I love what’s ignite trying to do but I honestly didn’t believe it was that big of an issue.


With the recent update to the Ignite Ratings beta platform, I decided to start building up my reputation by reviewing one ICO/crypto each day (which is really hard btw because not many people are willing to review my work :P ). I started by doing my own research based on reading whitepapers and googling some things up. As you could expect, the amount of shitty ICOs is overwhelming and I decided to check out what other “reputable” sources have to say about them. And it wasn’t pretty.


Today I reviewed iCasting.io, basically a Tinder for matching talented people with clients. On a blockchain. Perhaps a good idea but there is absolutely no need for the blockchain tech in it. Close to 0 token utility plus some other budgeting decisions make it an obvious cash grab.


What does icobench has to say? 4.1 overall score, “experts” praising this with lame statements such as as “strong team, great advisory board, bold vision etc”. THIS IS SCARY. Out of 11 reviews, only two where honest and authors were immediately discredited and downvoted. But take a look yourself: https://icobench.com/ico/icasting-io/ratings#ratings

"CryptoCurrency market in 2017 had a significant growth, many cryptocurrencies grew by thousands of percent (%) and there will be a greater market growth in years to come due to increased adoption.

 For a transaction to take place, it must be validated and new blocks must be generated into the chain by miners. Proof-of-Work (PoW) is the first consensus used by early cryptocurrency networks such as Bitcoin, Ethereum; also the alternative way of transaction validation came into place known as Proof-of-Stake (PoS) algorithm. However, both consensus has two main disadvantages of low transaction speed and high transaction cost. As the number of network participants grow, the number of transactions waiting for validation increases too. 

This shows that these algorithms of consensus are not scalable enough to process the transactions in time, hence, traders often incur losses since they work with high volatile cryptocurrency market.

Which of the algorithm do you think is best for cashbery coin to operate on since they are poised to be a transferring resource dt will be ideal for both customers and businesses?

"Cointelegraph just put out an article in the middle of the night EST time (as they always do even though they are a U.S. company) which had ""SEC denied Bitcoin ETF's"" in the title. That wasn't the whole title and was not even the point of the article but they made sure to put that in their so that people's bots would read the headline and dump their BTC accordingly without stopping the process based on a better, human interpretation of the title of the article. It worked perfectly considering that giant red 15 minute candle happened right after the article was put out. The whole title is ""Abra CEO: SEC Denies Bitcoin ETFs Because Applicants Do Not Fit Industry Archetype"" and Cointelegraph obviously did this on purpose because there is a million other ways to name that article that don't have those FUD keywords.

SwissBorg Toronto team's Marco Guerriero and Ankit Mittal have developed the very first SwissBorg Crypto Indices. The SB Top20 and the SB Next30 are the first of the crypto lists that have been developed by SwissBorg to track cryptos tailored to individual investment tastes and preferences. With the indices, SwissBorg aims to give our community members a taste of what is to come with our investment app. The indices are customised menus or basket of cryptos that an individual would acquire together. 

The SwissBorg Top 20 Index tracks the performance of the Top20 Crypto assets weighted by market capitalization and capped at 20% per component. USD Tether and any other stablecoins are excluded from the calculation. The weights are re-calculated and adjusted every 20 days. The index starts on January 1st, 2016 at a value of 434.33$, which was the price of BTC USD on that date. This index provides a 2.5-year track record for investors to study. 

The [SwissBorg](https://swissborg.com/en/) Next30 Index is representative of smaller capitalization Crypto assets. It tracks the performance of the Top 30 Cryptos after the Top 20, weighted by market capitalization and capped at 5% per component. USD Tether and any other stablecoins are excluded from the calculation. The weights are re-calculated and adjusted every 20 days. The index starts on January 1st, 2017 at a value of 998.33, which was the price of BTC USD on that date providing a more than one-year track record for investors. 

Right now SwissBorg’s two indices plus BTC and Top20 are live on our website and can be consulted to track crypto assets. We aim to produce more indices that cater to different tastes for investment strategies. The motivation behind this soft launch is to introduce our community to what to expect in our investment app. These teasers for our investment app, are buckets of crypto assets picked by SwissBorg. Community members can go to the indices page on our website to consult and track; they will find listed the percentage of market percentages in which ratio they’d want to invest their crypto assets. The SwissBorg crypto asset indices will allow the user to diversify their investment. Enthusiasts can use our interactive charts to explore data covering over two years of each of the indices related to BTC and examine individual indices.  

[r/swissborg](https://www.reddit.com/r/swissborg/) is proud and delighted to take this pioneering step towards fulfilling our goal of building a wealth management ecosystem that aims to demystify and make accessible the world of cryptos for our community members and the world at large!

"[My website](https://crowdsound.net/lyrics) ([https://crowdsound.net/lyrics](https://crowdsound.net/lyrics)) is generating a song (melody and lyrics) from the microvotes of over 100,000 participants (writers).

In order to encourage more participation, I am considering creating a cryptocurrency to help motivate people to participate more.  These are my ideas so far:

* People would receive (mine) a new ""crowdsoundcoin"" every time they vote.
* Artists who make money from the song would then be encouraged to donate to the ""writers"".
* Proceeds from the donations would then be dispersed (as new crowdsoundcoins) in proportion to how many crowdsoundcoins that person owns.

So this would allow the writers to also be stakeholders in the song itself.

I am interested to hear your thoughts about this idea?

1. Would it be legal in the eyes of the SEC?  Considered tokens or securities?
2. Would a coin like this be easy to set up?  If so, which coin should I base this on?  Ethereum?
3. Would it be easy to add a coin like this to exchanges so that it could be traded with Bitcoin etc?
4. Is it a good idea in general to introduce a cryptocurrency to this site?  Is there anything I haven't considered?",Advice sought: creating a cryptocurrency for my website,CryptoCurrency

"If I'm wrong, I'm wrong, and I apologize. But the largest non-derivatives markets for Bitcoin and Ethereum are.... BTC/USDT and ETH/USDT. Total Tether volume on the day is almost 2x the total market cap of Tether.   


Why are people using this vs actual cash when pairs trading? As a real life trader, and long time market observer I call shenanigans. I'd love to be proven wrong, so if you can, please do. But Tether still hasn't proven they're backed by USDs 100% have they? And if they have, does there exist a binding contract held in escrow by a trusted third party?  


It seems like a bogus coin that's being used to have an outsized effect on the price of the other cryptos.

"[Liquid is a new cryptocurrency platform](https://www.liquid.com/) from Quoine that brings everything together under one roof: 

* **Enhanced liquidity**
* **Top security with cold wallet storage**
* **Multiple fiat pairs (USD, JPY, SGD, AUD, EUR)**
* **Intuitive UI and focus on user experience**
* **JFSA licensed, Big 4 audited**
* **All-in-one ICO platform**
* **No trading fees for crypto-fiat** 
* **Margin trading** 
* **Lending**
* **24/7 support** 
* **Robust KYC/AML** 
* **QASH utility token benefits**



#Liquidity

The lack of liquidity in cryptocurrency is a major problem. Our tech, the World Book, allows trades from different trading pairs to be matched, combining orders on Liquid into one currency-agnostic order book, which our users view in their currency of choice, while FX conversion happens under the bonnet to give all markets the liquidity they deserve.

Right now, the World Book is live for BTC, ETH, and BCH against fiat pairs. In time, this will be expanded to all cryptocurrencies and pairs on Liquid. 

But the liquidity doesn’t stop flowing there. We will expand the World Book and connect it to a global network of exchanges, creating a deep liquidity pool.


[Watch this video to see how our the World Book affects trading spreads in a massive way.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q68zB0Xj9nw) 

#The user experience 

Our whole platform is designed for the beginner, and built for the expert. We have listened to our customers and traders from around the world to help us identify what’s most important to them. It was important for us understand our audience along with their hopes, frustrations and aspirations. 

We have worked hard to ensure that our platform is an ideal gateway for new users, while we also offer sophisticated trading tools so experienced traders can do what they do best. You can see this in effect in our trading dashboard and, in particular, in the attention we have given to the margin trading experience. 

#A safe haven for token sales

Investing in ICOs can suck. There are so many things that can go wrong, so we created our own ICO hosting platform, which is great for investors and token issuers. 

You can invest in ICOs in a range of currencies in just a few simple clicks. You only have to provide KYC once to have access to all public sales on Liquid. All ICOs hosted on Liquid are thoroughly vetted. 

For token issuers, hosting through our ICO platform is great because you don’t have to worry about any of the token sale process. We take care of you at every step.

#QASH - our utility token

QASH, soon to be known as the Liquid Token, is the utility token on our platform. Using QASH provides our users with exclusive benefits on Liquid, such as:

* 50% trading fee discount 
* ICO participation benefits and bonuses if paying with QASH
* QASH holders can be eligible for airdrops 
* Trading rebate 
* Voting rights 
* Exclusive campaigns and events

QASH will be the lifeblood of Liquid. If you are interested in reading about the utility of the token in more detail, please read our blog about the utility.  

#Security

Security is everything in cryptocurrency. We have various processes in place that ensure your fund safety, mainly our cold storage and Iron Shield security protocols. 

Iron Shield is our user protection system that puts your account into cooldown if you change a security aspect of you account - password, email, 2fa. When in cooldown, you cannot change any of the other security aspects of the account. This makes it extremely unlikely a hacker can take over our users accounts. 



#Compliant

Liquid is focused on being regulation friendly. We wanted to build an exchange our customers can trust. We believe that regulation is the way forward in this industry. We want to follow the rules but push the boundaries. This is the best way for cryptocurrency to grow and for our users to be safe.

"We're seeing a lot of posters that don't understand one basic rule. Bitcoin dominance is now at 55%, rules overall with trading pairs. If the dominant crypto currency goes down all the alts and tokens go down. This happens for many reasons, one of them being FOMO: trading all back to btc because ""it can only go up now"".

"This is a spreadsheet that I have developed for myself over the last year or so. I have found it very helpful for keeping track of my crypto holdings (great for tax purposes) and how well my trading decisions have been (not great). I figure it's time to share.

&amp;#x200B;

There is a lot in here including;

&amp;#x200B;

Automatically updates crypto prices from coinmarketcap. Nearly 2000 coins. Just select which ones you want to track by typing in the name.

You can even choose your local Fiat currency and get live conversion rates for any country.

https://i.redd.it/ts3717egfkk11.png

&amp;#x200B;

No need to record details of every trade. Just keep track of your crypto purhcases (from fiat) and what coins you currently hold. The spreadsheet will calculate the rest and keep a record of how your portfolio and holdings have changed over time.

https://i.redd.it/zeon8s8xfkk11.png

This data gets saved every time you save the spreadsheet.

https://i.redd.it/gne0jd2agkk11.png

I find this very handy to see if your trading is actually profitable compared to the HODL method.

https://i.redd.it/x71gvgj2ikk11.png

Oh yes and there are plenty of 'moon math' and analytics to see how bitcoin is trending and how far off you are from a lambo. This includes a full history of bitcoins price which updates every time you open the sheeet.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/cyn98q63hkk11.png

Plenty more bits and pieces that I have tinkered with over time.

free download from here. Instructions inside. You probably need a fairly recent version of microsft excel with macros enabled (if you want it to do the fancy stuff).

wanted to share this with you: https://www.ibm.com/blockchain

IBM is pushing heavy on their Blockchain tech (Germany here), ads running everywhere with usable solutions for Business. I was interested and went to look at it how they implemented it.

This is their main partner: https://www.hyperledger.org/

IBM is not hiding it, they talk on the solutions they have together with Hyperledger and for what those solutions can be used. And no, there is no token. The main usages advertised are: Food safety, Private equity &amp; Trusted identity with many possible fields hinted at.

As I see it, they have finished the integration of blockchain tech in their business solution portfolio. You dont get more adoption that this. 

I know many will not like how this look, with the usual shit-talk in comments, but remember, the customer decides which products they use, and this seems to be the solution which they want and use.  No Moon and Lambo guys.

So someone correct me if I'm wrong but some whale moves 100k plus bitcoins into over a 1000 different wallets and then moves 100 million dollars worth to a couple exchanges and that causes bitcoin to drop almost 500 bucks and takes down all Altcoins with it too. Am I the only one who is not cool with this?  I'm sorry but a system built around glass see through wallets has failed all of us today.  Look man I have no problem with people who have enough money to feed Ethiopia for a hundred years. Good for them.
